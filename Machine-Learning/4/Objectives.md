* Intro to Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Nets are composed of
    1) Input Nodes
    
    2) Output Nodes

    3) Layers of nodes

    4) Weights between nodes in layer i and layer i+1

    5) Hidden Nodes

* Flask to create a Machine Learning API

* Intro to Deep Neural Networks

These are Neural Nets where there are many layers stacked between the Input and Output Nodes

* Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing

A convolutional NN is used commonly for image data. This is because CNNs combine neighboring pixel values and pass those aggregatiuons down to other hidden layers. The effect is a special NN that generates features automatically that can then be learned. These features can be things like the edges of the image and other things that wouldn't make sense for a human but make sense for the algorithm.
