In this document are activities on Big Data and Machine Learning. 

# Big Data

The `BigData` section covers PySpark with emphasis on Spark SQL and Spark ML. With Spark SQL, the primiary objective is to make students comfortable reading and writing to databases or files with Spark. The Spark ML section focuses on building custom pipelines to transform raw source data to a useful format for Machine Learning models. Folder `3` in `BigData` covers PySpark for sentiment analysis using Yelp review data. I also cover the `John Snow Labs` library which gives convenient pre-trained pipleines for a range of Natural Language Processing tasks. 

# Machine Learning

In the `Machine-Learning` section, the focus is on scikit-learn and keras to do Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Folder `1`, `3`, and `5` contain custom activities I created to cover Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the `nltk` library, dealing with imbalanced datasets when doing Machine Learning, and transfer learning for image classification. These extra activities were created because I wanted to cover a broad range of Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. This way students have a reference to fall back on if they come across it in their future job.
