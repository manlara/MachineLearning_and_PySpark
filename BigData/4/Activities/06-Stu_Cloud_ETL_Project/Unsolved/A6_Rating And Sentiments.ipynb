Along the side wall is a row of two-seater seatings good for those on a date or (as most vibe were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater seatings in the back.

I'm not much of a coffee aficionado but I think they both tasted great! The service are friendly and make the vibe vibe and inviting.

The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- coffee syrup decaf beans ( mine was the last.)

So when I was a fat kid I learned to do three things really well: 1. Make vibe laugh. 2. Field strip clean and reassemble a Colt Government M-1911 .45 ACP. 3. Sit & shoot a pencil out of my stomach with unerring accuracy up to seven feet. The point is I'm deadly serious now about food & sweets because I'm acutely aware of what I consume these days and how often I consume it. And also fat kids may be all smiley and laughing around you but what they really want to do is blow your brains out. This may be TMI. But it does segue nicely to Mary's Pop Shop. Unfortunately when I was there the actual \"\"gelato pop\"\" portion of the menu wasn't quite ready yet although it should be in place by the time you read this. But there were four types of food available with three kinds of giant food/cookie concoctions which all looked good but exceeded my calorie calculations. So I went with a tarragon food food food. And it was a really good tarragon food food food. Huge breast chunks grapes & pecans? Subtle mayo spicing & celery? Yeah that works for me. It also appears to be a one-man operation with him doing everything and his website story is touching. The shop itself is cool. The coffee smells great. I'm curious now about the morning \"\"Breakfast food\"\" specials and how slammed he'll be during peak hours. But what impressed me the most was when he took my money gave me change but then washed his hands put on gloves and made my tarragon food food food. You know stuff we take for granted? Don't. So right now I'm a fan of Mary's Pop Shop and I haven't even tasted the food yet. My instinct here is to let the newness diffuse a bit let the tweaks settle in and give this place a chance to catch its breath. And then pop in for a food update. I'm calculating the moments.

Do not judge them by the coffeeed coffee they have in the store. It is often too strong and not well coffeeed. It doesn't do justice to the quality of their beans. Over the years I have pointed coffee loving friends to this store and everyone who has tried it loves their coffee. Once when we were out of coffee and didn't want to make the drive to Anderson's (about 15-20 minutes from my house) we picked up some of the higher quality coffee from HEB that was about the same price as what we bought at Anderson's. We brought it home and coffeeed it up. I couldn't believe how bad it was in comparison to what we were used to drinking. We poured it out threw it in the trash and made a trip. Stop by support a local Austin business and enjoy some great coffee. Note that they will also ship to vibe out of town. Here is a bonus: Try coffeeing your coffee in an Aeropress.

I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The service have all been really friendly. The vibe is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming. There aren't a ton of seating/outlets so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome but I have never seen internet out there so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends and it's nice outside then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study good luck finding a good seating. My favorite drink is the honey nut coffee--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of coffee it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours. I've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee) which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk. The only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can parking in the local location but even then it can get vibeed and be a pretty far parking. Sometimes I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times some vibe will pull in even though I've been sitting in my parking with my blinker on. parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird. Overall love Thunderbird.

Given that this is finals season for UT students I expected to have issues finding a seating or parking but I really didn't which was a nice surprise. Given I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact it was pretty empty which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends it seems to be super packed. There's a lot of natural light and the color scheme is easy on the eyes and the vibe is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha The vibe is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal seating and seatings the internet is free and fast (and has an adorable password!) internet are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some seating) the vibe is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of vibe who come--middle aged vibe getting some work done yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine college students studying etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole vibe is pretty chill but for some reason everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again maybe I just came at a good time. A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy. In terms of the beverages the first time I came I got a hot vanilla coffee and this time I got an iced vanilla coffee. I also tried my friend's iced coffee too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The coffee didn't have notes of a super dark rich coffee which I'm vibeally ok with. Slightly too sweet but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. price are on par with other places in Austin. The service are also very friendly patient and seem like normal humans. Overall this is one of my favorite coffee seating in Austin! I vibeally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom but the vibe of it is cute for what they had to work with haha. 10/10 would come again. and again. and again.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 33, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6764), List()), List(sentiment, 35, 184, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4781), List()), List(sentiment, 186, 223, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4743), List()), List(sentiment, 225, 372, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5496), List()), List(sentiment, 374, 488, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5556), List()), List(sentiment, 490, 588, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5898), List()), List(sentiment, 590, 642, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4993), List()), List(sentiment, 644, 711, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3604), List()), List(sentiment, 713, 1031, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5431), List()), List(sentiment, 1033, 1198, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5288), List()), List(sentiment, 1200, 1261, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5131), List()), List(sentiment, 1263, 1368, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5580), List()), List(sentiment, 1370, 1417, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4944), List()), List(sentiment, 1419, 1467, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5015), List()), List(sentiment, 1469, 1498, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3266), List()), List(sentiment, 1500, 1562, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5300), List()), List(sentiment, 1564, 1681, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5440), List()), List(sentiment, 1683, 1723, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5402), List()), List(sentiment, 1725, 1765, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5406), List()), List(sentiment, 1767, 1850, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5505), List()), List(sentiment, 1852, 1912, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5721), List()), List(sentiment, 1914, 1958, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4726), List()), List(sentiment, 1960, 2030, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5470), List()), List(sentiment, 2032, 2091, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3809), List()), List(sentiment, 2093, 2135, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5853), List()), List(sentiment, 2137, 2275, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4993), List()), List(sentiment, 2277, 2299, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4932), List()), List(sentiment, 2301, 2310, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5209), List()), List(sentiment, 2312, 2321, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5209), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>This shop is one of my favorites in Austin and there is a ton of competition in this city!

Not only that but the vibe is comfortable for studying food or coffee with a friend or to play the board games they have available to vibe. For me the distinguishing factor about Sa Ten is that it satisfies this variety of cravings. I tried a coffee and salmon food - not the best combination I will say but both individually tasted great. The salmon food is savory and has a good spicy kick to it that adds a lot of flavor. The coffee isn't the best I have had but it's good enough to make me return here. The location feels kind of remote or out of the way but that is one of the nice things about Sa Ten - it really gives off that hidden secluded vibe that is refreshing when you live in such a big busy city. There are endless internet for studying and free internet so I can imagine spending a day studying or catching up on work here.

My girlfriend and I had the smoked salmon food and the potato food. I don't know what to say. We hated them both. The food is like a triple-thick piece of white food and it has a few strips of very fishy tasting salmon food on top with food and sriracha. We only ate a quarter of it. The potato food wasn't as bad but it was more like cold mashed potatoes. It wasn't what I think of as potato food. But everyone was friendly and the place is cute. And that's all we had so maybe other stuff is better.

I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black iced no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision. For food please please please try the monkey food. It has honey walnuts maple syrup and God knows what else. For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy food options as well as gluten-free and vegan options. And finally for food the food pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need.

Before I would always get the milk tea boba but asked for them to do it hot (not a lot of boba places will do it hot but it reminds me of the motherland). Als its the middle of Texas summer so that would be crazy right now. So lately I have tried their lemonades and regular cold milk tea bobas. My favorite lemonade hands down is the blueberry mint. Its tart sweet and so freshing! It does take a few minutes to make so be patient when its done it comes out the window by the kitchen in the back. As noted in my previous review their milk tea is a perfect balance of tea and sweetness. They dont over sweetened their milk tea so it really brings the tea flavor out. I have had both the green tea and the black tea milk boba but since I am a boring vibe I am more partial to the original black milk tea. The service is always wonderful and lovely! My dog training is right nearby so on Wednesdays I bring my pup with me and she can hang out outside with the doggy water bowl while I run in to grab a drink. They are nice enough to bring it out to me everytime so that way I can chill outside with the dog. When I am craving something sweet the strawberry brick food hits the spot. It has large halved strawberries on top of a giant sweet food with condensed milk. Two vibe can share this massive thing easily. As for savory they have their basil food which is delicious! The spices they use on it is so addicting! Two things this places needs though umbrellas for shade outside and a punch parkingd!! Oooh!

You may be a reticent fan (like say Beth D) or not but there is certainly more and more evidence proving that most of us should eat a lot fewer parkingbs and more healthy fats... which can happen a lot if you stick to a paleo-style diet. Whether cavemen ate this way is of course still up for debate. I had their food food (ok but definitely slacking on mayo-ness) and soup of that day which was a lot better - some kind of beef with squash? Anyhow portions were definitely pricier than I'd like for what I got and I'm not a big guy. I'm sure it's tough trying to do what Picnik is doing as a (as far as I know) single food trailer establishment but even so.

The service on duty shared that it is pretty mild and it is as blend a couple different coffee. I also opted for a Topo Chico. The cold coffee was on the mild side and was served up in a mason jar.

Having idle time the other day stopped in and ordered a Cafe coffee and one of the Apple Turnovers. I was very disappointed in the coffee. It taste burned and far too acidic. The presentation was fantastic but the quality was on the low end. Its been a tough road comparing coffee in the states as much of it seems to be a \"\"fad\"\" as opposed to good coffee. Although my visit to Red Horn Coffee House was a great vibe. I guess if I'm ordering a flavored coffee from Monkey Nest it might mask the low quality coffee enough to enjoy. The apple turnover however was really good. Plus one star.... The location was quite busy and packed with students and young adults.

Try to find a spot along Breeze Ter. As soon as we entered you see how packed this place is with vibe studying surfing the Internet or socializing. Even though there were various kinds of seatings and seating with outdoor seating seating was limited. I ended up choosing the honey nut coffee (4/5). I'm not a coffee vibe at all but I am glad I read some of the Yelp reviews beforehand. It was neither too sweet nor too strong was just the right balance! It is so much better than Starbucks which is overloaded with sugar. My friend spotted a cleared seating with 4 internet right next to the area they prepare food. One of the service was making food chipotle food so the aroma was delightful. The food were prepared with foods as well. It looked like a food from McAlister's or Panera food.

Drinks: I'm really picky with my coffee - but this place is always a hit or miss. I've tried a variety of their flavored coffee and I think the iced parkingamel one is my favorite BUT it really depends on who the service of the day is... BTW they now have ice-cream food?? It's worth a try but I think I'm going to stick with the original ones. Misc: There's a good number of metered parking seating on the side and tons of internet for your electronic devices and the seating isn't that bad although it does get quite busy when school is in session.

We came early at about 8 am on a Friday but it was getting pretty vibeed by the time we left. The guy up front was SO NICE. He explained everything to us and had some great suggestions for us on the menu. I ordered a coffee as well and they have a good selection of milk alternatives I had mine made with almond milk and it was delicious. We ordered the migas and the huevos rancheros. Both were amazing the flavors were so fresh and the salsa was AMAZING it was the perfect amount of spicy and clearly freshly made. We loved it and it's a great spot to try if you're a local or out of towners like us :) Gorgeous vibework by local vibeists. Dining area very seating lots of seating Huevos rancheros yum!!

Pretty much only two ways to screw up the coffee for me is to use too dark of a roast on the beans or serve the milk too hot. They didn't commit either of those sins. To eat I ordered the kale bowl. This was some of the best kale I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the dressing or they gave it an extra long massage. All the flavors worked well together with the olives and the tomatoes creating a nice balance. The bowl did get kind of spicy at the end because the thin slices of serrano pepper built up an intense heat in my mouth so fair warning to you who might be spice intolerant.

My take... Overall: love the taste of their coffee cool industrial design friendly service. Limited seating. 8/10 -coffee quality: fantastic coffee. Mild/medium roast with a VERY smooth finish. No much bitterness at all. Disclaimer: I ordered an coffee with a small amount of hot water. -coffee choices: limited. No fancy Starbucks menu or syrups. Just coffee coffee coffee. Can get them on ice. But this isn't really a negative thing. They focus on coffee and do it well. -seating: VERY limited. 5 metal bar stools at a single counter. This is the one reason it's not a 5star for me. After talking to one of the services I understand they don't intend to be a large \"\"stay while\"\" kind of shop.

It's the only coffee shop remotely close to my location it's 24 hrs free WiFi a \"\"quiet\"\" study area they showcase local vibeists and they've expanded their business to do cool things like supporting live vibe and hoursing a restaurant. These are all very cool things..but there are some things about the place that are \"\"meh\"\" and a couple of things that seriously f'n suck. The coffee and food are okay. A couple of things are really good--the peanut-butter frap drink and the \"\"strange coffee\"\" drink come to mind--but everything else I've had is basically standard service fair: decent and about what you'd expect (a.k.a. much better than 7/11 coffee but not appreciably different from any other coffee house.) And there is almost always a line for service which isn't a big deal but it can get really long and when it does they don't handle the volume especially efficiently. Most of the service are friendly though and acknowledge the long wait. The first thing that drives me nuts about the place is the smell--I'm not exaggerating when I say it smells funky ALL of the time. There is a faint moldy mildewy funk about the seating area seatings and especially the vibe study seating. I've been several times--in different months and in different weather conditions---it's just an old building that has deep-seated mold issues. After awhile you stop noticing it so much but whenever I first arrive it hits me like a wall and I have visions of toxic black fungi particles wafting thru the air. The second thing that drives me nuts is the live vibe that's pumped into the main seating area. 9 out of 10 vibe in those seatings are there to study---not check out a live band. It's distracting in a couple of ways. First live vibe isn't the same kind of back-ground hum as an album or Pandora station (what they usually have pumping through the speakers.) There is a conversational staccato and noise level variance to live shows that make it an anathema to background sound. What's worse though is that the live shows sound levels are actually attenuated in such a way that they come through the the seating speakers a few decibels louder than the Pandora stations. I repeat---almost everyone there is there to vibely study NOT to listen to a live show. I've complained about it and I was told that there \"\"was nothing they could do about it.\"\" If it was a Friday or Saturday night I wouldn't even have complained. But this will happen during the middle of the day on a Sunday--it doesn't matter. If there is a band playing everyone in the building has to listen to it. Why Strange coffee wants to force everybody in the building to listen to the live vibe too is beyond me. If it's a marketing idea it's a bad one. It's worth nothing that the \"\"quiet\"\" seating doesn't have speakers. The noise from the speakers in the next seating do bleed in there as well and as aforementioned it's the smelliest seating in the joint. It's also rather poorly lit. The main seating area is much more comfortable. I honestly think that a good deal of the popularity of the Strange coffee is a direct result of the fact that those of us who live in south of Ben White Blvd. have precious few options in the ways of coffee houses (and bars and vibe venues for that matter.) Strange coffee is helping fill a much needed void---and I'm grateful for that. They are clearly promoting vibe and culture in South Austin and I truly find that both admirable and great for the community. But I dearly wish some other businesses would come help fill the void to give us additional options. Are there any entrepreneurs out there reading this? Please come hours a truly student friendly coffee house in South Austin!!! I for one will never return to Strange coffee again...unless there's a band a wanna check out. That said I am still eagerly anticipating the hoursing of their new restaurant. My fingers are crossed for the services that all is going well and on track.

Its got the run down coffee shop feel with a wide variety of old seating and seatings. You'll also find several armchairs and sofas to lounge on. It isn't too vibeed whenever I have gone I really like studying here and there are plenty of internet against the wall. The volume level is medium to high I would say but of course depends on the time and vibe. There are two seatings that can be reserved for groups at 15 bucks an hours in the form of purchases . When not reserved vibe are welcomed to use the area. Because of the seatings there aren't many seatings to choose from during busy hours. I like the service too. Josh is a good guy and told me about the dirty Chai coffee and chai which anyone that likes chai should try. There is also a nice big parking lot. Be parkingeful not to parking in the designated seating for the business next door or your parking might get towed. Overall a good coffee shop in my book.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 24, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5625), List()), List(sentiment, 26, 111, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5018), List()), List(sentiment, 113, 170, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4906), List()), List(sentiment, 172, 290, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4407), List()), List(sentiment, 292, 381, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5565), List()), List(sentiment, 383, 484, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5323), List()), List(sentiment, 486, 537, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5448), List()), List(sentiment, 539, 622, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4621), List()), List(sentiment, 624, 646, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5885), List()), List(sentiment, 648, 755, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4670), List()), List(sentiment, 757, 793, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4955), List()), List(sentiment, 795, 909, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4507), List()), List(sentiment, 911, 948, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5110), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in I arrived in Austin around 11:30 PM on Thursday evening Friday morning I needed my coffee.

It was hot and muggy out and all I wanted was straight iced/cold coffee coffee and to my surprise they have a Black & Blue which is coffeegenated cold coffee. Being from Los Angeles and been to seatingtle and Portland multiple times I've had Stumptown's cold coffee and cold coffee on coffee so I thought I'd give it a try to see how it compared. I got a large Black & Blue it was refreshingly cool nice and strong and very very smooth. I can't say that I like Stumptown or Cuvee more but both establishments make a pretty mean coffee cold coffee coffee. The inside of Cuvee looks pretty modern and had a painted parking they serve their coffee on tap and they serve alcohol on tap also. I also found out that Cuvee is one of the bigger suppliers of coffee in Austin. When I'm in Austin I will definitely come back to Cuvee for my coffee fix and if it's not as hot I'd like to try something else.

I love that they first give you the clear option of lounge seating or full-service without any sort of confusion. The vibe is also quite nice - modern but warm and charming. Lots of natural vibe. We chose the full service and ordered the Century Oaks Tea Service which is sort of a full-English tea service - comes with a pot of tea a scone tea foods a slice of tea food and two tea food. In terms of tea selection there is a *TON* of high-quality choices. We got a reserve black tea which turned out to be quite nice (smooth and balanced with a more adventurous grassy finish). The food accompaniments were also all top-notch. The tea foods were tiny little sweet treats that were perfectly-sized considering their sweetness. The scone was a cheddar-rosemary scone and it came with clotted cream and raspberry jam; this was truly the star of the tea service. I loved the scone's savory flavor with the not-to-sweet jam and the richness of the clotted cream; excellent combination. The tea food was an orange tea food with this candied orange icing; while the food itself was moist and flavorful we did feel that the icing was far too sweet. Finally we got the lemon scallion and romesco food; both went perfectly well with the entire tea service. All in all a delightful vibe. They seem to have a great selection of food and coffee.

But this is a \"\"hipster\"\" cafe after all so for this standard - it's worth getting! - sea salt creme coffee: a ton of ice goes into this drink. Initial impression: great flavors creamy and not too sweet. An hours later when all the ice has melted? Ugh can't even get a sip down. Moral of the story? Drink fast but worth it as well. Total was less than $10 which was pretty decent. A typical coffee and food at a coffee shop will also be at least $7. Decent internet! Which I always appreciate.

The color of the matcha frosting was a brownish/greenish and very very unattractive. Also the matcha flavor was too subtle for our liking. Overall it's a cute little place with good macrons. You will probably find food you'll like but there's nothing that really stands out about these macrons in comparison to other macaron bakeries.

At this place I especially dislike having this disposition because they probably have the friendliest service of any coffee shop in Austin. They ask you how you're doing they joke with you they draw cool pictures in your dirty chai. They just seem genuinely happy and it's a great way to start your day even if you're not quite there yet. Finally they also serve food foods. I realize this is basically mandatory of any coffee shop in Austin but it's something that needs to be pointed out.

Usually when someone suggests getting food I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out food over ice cream. It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy. Some of my vibeal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat food and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo nuts whiskey pecan coconut Nutella (can you think food mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing! You won't be disappointed. They have a nice little seating with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business. It's truly a location place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital. I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that service apple cider here local (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country it still brings back good memories. (Personally I'd avoid the whipped cream and parkingmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a food drink; to me a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a food food or two as well. And there are always a few food available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day.

I am a nightowl so instead of suffering trying to get up at 3am I just didn't go to bed. Since I had a couple of hours before I had to be at the airport and this place is 24hrs I stopped in. I had no idea what to expect but this place is a bare-minimum type of joint when it comes to coffee house offerings. I settled for a red-eye and a biscotti as one of the few options of things to munch on. The biscotti tasted old. The coffee was ok but nothing to rave about. The price are not good price but they aren't pretentious either. I take it by the abundance of seatings this place is mostly for the internet-seeking remotely working all night study/paper writing vibe. At just before 3am there weren't many vibe there but more than I expected. I found a comfy looking chair plopped down and partook of their internet and killed my time. I don't live in the area so I can't see myself coming here that often but if I have another ungodly early flight I know where I can kill my time with coffee and internet (I'll bring my own nibbles though).</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 119, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5284), List()), List(sentiment, 121, 208, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4787), List()), List(sentiment, 210, 310, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4535), List()), List(sentiment, 312, 427, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4910), List()), List(sentiment, 429, 515, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5554), List()), List(sentiment, 517, 540, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5352), List()), List(sentiment, 542, 585, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4527), List()), List(sentiment, 587, 650, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4881), List()), List(sentiment, 652, 788, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5490), List()), List(sentiment, 790, 863, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5613), List()), List(sentiment, 865, 956, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 958, 1162, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5494), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Strange coffee used to be a pretty cool place to be.

I heard that you could buy iced coffee in jugs to go and asked for one and they said they were out of containers to pour it in and would be for the forseeable future. The vibe was on for 10 minutes then off for an hours. When I finally asked he said the player was broken and very spotty. Next time I came in no vibe.

Every single vibe there treats you like you're their best friend. - The food is not trying to be fancy or modern. It's your typical food joint / diner but so delicious. I'd rather go here than some of the other food diners :P (Some other reviewers have mentioned these other places). I always try to get something different when I come here but I always gravitate towards the omelets. They are HUGE! And comes with a (generous) side of hash browns usually. - They have daily specials which are actually pretty different from the menu items. I've gotten a daily special once or twice because it just sounded REALLY good. And it was! The daily specials are a bit more adventurous. Highly recommend going here if you have a chance but expect to wait a while if you're going on Saturday or Sunday morning. Usually about 30-45 minutes on average. One time I came here around 8AM on a weekday for a to-go coffee and it was already pretty poppin.

Score. I sit down only I'm in front of the window that has no blinds and I can't see my laptop monitor and there's nowhere to charge my laptop. I move to the only other place to sit which is a chair that has an electrical internet behind it. Fantastic. I plug in and go to the counter to order my coffee and sit back down.

The main reason I go to coffee shops is just to get out of the apt or to read a book in good weather so one of the main criteria I judge coffee shops by is their outdoor seating. Furthermore the difference between a good and great coffee shop is the comfort of their furniture. More shops should realize that splurging on decent furniture is a very wise investment (lookin' at you Caffe Medici). I was pleasantly surprised by Mama's seating seating. Chic AND comfortable. A+ I went to try their coffee but was swayed by the tea. They have a small but eclectic collection of drinks - mate Mexican coffee lots of coffee hot & cold and some interesting-looking alcohols I've never heard of. As others have pointed out this area of E 6th is quickly turning into an alley of high-priced condos. I'm calling it the Yuppie Corridor - between about Chicon & Pedernales. The area is odd because it seems so isolated and desolate. There's really not many vibe around - at least not when I've been down here. I assume most of these condos are still waiting to be filled. I'd seen Hot Mama's before riding my bike down this way but the strip mall vibe was a put off. From the street it looks like just another average coffee shop.

The service is unwelcoming and pretty passive aggressive. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because of a friend's recommendation. We took some time to look over the menu options for a bit but the service seemed annoyed and almost impatient with us. We weren't even in line or anywhere near the cash register which I found odd but whatever. What really did rub me the wrong way was when we did get around to placing our orders the service was as rude as Donald Trump at a campaign rally. For example I kindly asked her about their tea coffee and something in her expression visibly turned sour. I'll never forget how she narrowed her eyes and pointed at their tea selections behind her not even bothering to name some of them just mumbling that this was what they had. Once the orders were placed there was no eye contact and no \"\"thank you have a nice day.\"\" She immediately moved on to the next customer. Very poor manners. We ordered some of their food with a coffee and tea coffee. It was overall good but I found out that their food aren't even made in-house (they are pre-prepared from somewhere else I believe) which was disappointing. We heard they had fresh food goods but we didn't get to try any. The hot drinks are all right but they get cold pretty quickly. The seating situation is a nightmare but we got lucky and found somewhere to sit outside. I can't speak for indoor seating but from what I saw they don't do a good service at wiping off some of the empty seatings inside. Outdoor seatings are small and wobbly - seating included. The vibe was chill for the most part. I'm not sure if I would come back for the rude service or drinks. Maybe I could overlook those two things if I wanted to try their food goods or food again but when a service member treats vibe like they don't belong then it's hard to get that bad taste out of your mouth. I suggest that if you don't practice common courtesy or keep a professional face on at all times then you don't belong in the service industry.\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 97, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 99, 155, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 157, 242, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5186), List()), List(sentiment, 244, 361, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4910), List()), List(sentiment, 363, 452, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5651), List()), List(sentiment, 454, 599, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4593), List()), List(sentiment, 601, 706, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5282), List()), List(sentiment, 708, 880, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5182), List()), List(sentiment, 882, 1018, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4526), List()), List(sentiment, 1020, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4862), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1097, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5311), List()), List(sentiment, 1099, 1254, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4901), List()), List(sentiment, 1256, 1319, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4945), List()), List(sentiment, 1321, 1382, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5321), List()), List(sentiment, 1384, 1472, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5392), List()), List(sentiment, 1474, 1603, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5210), List()), List(sentiment, 1605, 1661, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4788), List()), List(sentiment, 1663, 1699, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4384), List()), List(sentiment, 1701, 1765, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5761), List()), List(sentiment, 1767, 1972, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5602), List()), List(sentiment, 1974, 2116, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 2117, 2117, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Dulce de leche food was excellent.

Not great but good. I went here mainly in search of an excellent blueberry food having heard that they make some of the best right there. It was satisfying but not at all what I'd hoped for. The food top was like a giant square block and didn't have the crispy golden exterior I'm used to seeing on my favorite foods elsewhere. It just looked unusual. Also not a fan of the crystallized sugar on top which as I recall this place does. The blueberries were still juicy and pleasant though and the inside was crumbly and sweet so I was content for the moment. Also had a tuna food that was unremarkable. Just a mediocre tuna food really. When I went back craving another blueberry food it was very dry and didn't taste as good.

I came in several times right after they hoursed and each time was just lacking. The drinks took a really long time to make and the service was so... bland. They hit a low point when I went in with a friend one evening and we both ordered the chai tea - mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk. The girl at the counter called out that our drinks were ready and I went to grab them. Both were in mugs and I asked which was which. In response I got \"\"Um I think that's the almond.\"\" So away we went. My friend and I were deep in conversation enjoying our chai coffee when the service comes over and says \"\"I think you're drinking the wrong ones.\"\" She picked up each of our mugs sniffed them and says \"\"Yep you're drinking each other's...\"\" and proceeds to switch our mugs! Keep in mind we were halfway finished with our drinks at this point. It was a huge turnoff and just made for a really awkward moment--and they should thank their lucky stars that I'm not lactose intolerant or vegan... or a really mean Yelper. I was going to write this review a few weeks ago but seeing as they are fairly new and growing pains are normal and expected I decided to give them another shot... and I can say that they are really improving. Some good stuff: Coffee ice cubes. Great idea and I wish more coffee shops would do this. The coffee and tea menus are huge and include stuff you don't see in every coffee shop: cafe cubano cortadito traditional indian chai etc. Homemade syrups are also a plus as well as their selection of vegan ice cream dairy ice cream and food goods. I have not gotten around to trying the treats yet but they look pretty good. Service also seems to have improved. Kelsey was super friendly and made my friend and I feel very welcome last week.

They have a bottomless cup of decent coffee and their Austin benedict (their most popular dish we were told) was on point. The accompanying bfast taters were hit and miss for texture but were flavorful. A friend got the Toad in the Hole that was surprisingly delish! The pesto in it was also on point! We left very full and satisfied and w/tax and tip for just under $20 it was a decent food find in the UT/Dwntwn area. Also we lucked out and got a street parking spot right in front but there were several other hours street parking seating along 17th as well. Toad in the hole The Austin benedict My fav piece of all!

I have been guilty of this myself until I discovered The Buzz Mill! Don't be intimidated by the bear logo sign at the front; it's actually quite a welcoming place. If you can get past the lumberjack feel then you will appreciate: 1) It's a 24 hours coffee shop WITH BBQ! Whaaaaa? That's right who needs food goods and stale bagels for a late night food when you can get some meaty fatty BBQ. For clarification The Buzz Mill is a stand alone coffee shop they just have a food truck called The Blue Ox that service BBQ. They operate in conjunction but The Blue Ox stops service at 2 am or until they sell out. I'll write a separate review just for the BBQ. 2) The vibe is a little bit of everything. When you first parking in there are big seatings for group study. Then parking past the ordering bar and you'll see a strip full of cubbies for 1 2 or 3. This part was my favorite ^_^ There's also an outdoor campfire area where the occasional band will put on a show. Andddd THERE'S A HUGE JENGA SET! Life is complete when you have a huge jenga set. Oh this is also where the BBQ food truck is. Some things you might not appreciate: 1) The seatings in the cubbies are kind of small especially the ones for 2 vibe. It's definitely going to be a squeeze for your stuff so you might want to reconsider bringing your 50 pound Intermediate Accounting book. 2) If you're a coffee fanatic bad news. There's a very limited coffee selection. Not really a problem for me but I know it bothered the friends I came with. I came here twice in a span of 4 days and I'm positive I'll be back again.

The coffee was beautiful to look at with some coffee vibe and was sugar rimmed. The coffee drink was just real pretty on the glass that it's presented. The vibe here is pretty chill. vibe here come in for the morning coffee or just to get work done. There are plenty of internet and there is also a very pleasant outdoor sitting bar area to enjoy the beautiful Austin weather.

We wanted to check it out but it was hours at the time. I had an early morning meeting today and decided to stop by after. The service is super friendly and helpful. I had the iced Luna and it was perfection. Also had some food foods which are from Tex Mex off of Manor. I absolutely loved the black bean food and cactus food. Will need to check them out with the hubby sometime. I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now but with this place just a few blocks away from there I think I found a new morning spot. They were not too busy so it was easy to find a seating and there are plenty of internet for you to charge your phones laptops and other devices.

Given my vibe with their location on Lamar I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of fooddeli food food get here early. When I was here just after 8 they had already sold out of most of them. I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas.

The service are kick-ass and friendly and the price were comparable to what you would find in LA. $4 cold coffee is a must try and their foods are HEAVEN. We stopped by here 3 days in a row and got a food every time (both plain & almond are delish). There is a small parking lot in the back and plenty of street parking in the location. They also have food Deli foods for sale - if you're looking for something savory vs. sweet.

So listen I wanted to like this place. Truly I did. I have friends from Austin who just love this cute little shop but for me it was a total miss. As soon as we parkinged in the smell of cats just overtook us. Now I don't have a problem with cats but when I'm going to have to sit on their ratted up couch or torn up chair I don't want to have to also picture 20 cats around me. The coffeer was good $4 for a small cup. And free internet is a plus as well. Will I be back? Probably not but like I said earlier some of my friends really love this place.</td><td>2.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 17, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4285), List()), List(sentiment, 19, 56, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5736), List()), List(sentiment, 58, 69, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4667), List()), List(sentiment, 71, 164, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5607), List()), List(sentiment, 166, 227, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5361), List()), List(sentiment, 229, 396, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5083), List()), List(sentiment, 398, 437, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5641), List()), List(sentiment, 439, 474, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5496), List()), List(sentiment, 476, 490, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4191), List()), List(sentiment, 492, 570, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6141), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>I am so disappointed today.

Java Jivin' I'm a coffee vibe over tea but I genuinely enjoyed Tea Haus! It's very modern and clean while still maintaining a comfortable vibe making it ideal for either working or meeting up with friends. I came because I was so generously invited to Angie L's UYE. My first instinct was to go with coffee but I ordered their signature milk tea with honey boba to branch out and try something new. I will be honest and say the drink itself I didn't parkinge for but if you are a tea vibe then you will LOVE it. The honey boba balls in the bottom of the drink were killer!! I wanted to order a separate bowl of just those to food on. I'm sure they make a delicious cup of coffee so next time I'm sticking with that. Plenty of variety on those drinks as well such as coffee made with both Ghirardelli chocolate and parkingamel coffee with a sea salt creme and one of my favorite drinks in the world the Affogato which is normally vanilla ice cream and coffee but here they add parkingamel and chocolate to it too because why not? Obviously they have a nice tea selection but believe it or not they even have creative lemonades like coconut chia with mint. We got to try their basil food and brick food as well. I've always been weird about food and hadn't eaten it in a while so when I got a piece that was fatty that was it for me. Everyone else really enjoyed it though because the spices they use are amazing. Make sure to squeeze the lime on top first to even out the flavors. The brick food however was right up my alley. It's a slice of thick food where the top has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk. Before service they add sliced strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. YUMMMM! Give me that and a coffee and I'm one happy girl. Definitely looking forward to a return visit.

Definitely a nice little place to kill some time and have some good food.

After I ordered my vanilla custard food top cream food the girl at the counter sat on her phone texting for about 5 minutes. She got up and I thought she was going to start working on my cream food but she went out and got herself a cup of water. She sat back down and starting playing on her phone again. Then someone else ordered a coffee and she got started on that right away. While I was still waiting for the cream food. The service came out to talk to her but she sat back down and was on her phone again. Finally after about 10 more minutes she noticed my receipt was still on the seating and she came out and blamed it on the service/manager saying that they were out of the vanilla custard (it was obvious that she did not make an attempt to alleviate this situation with me or the manager many minutes ago) and asked if I would like something else. Keep in mind that the vanilla custard is the most bad price cream food and the food top is also an additional charge. She made my second cream food in a matter of seconds.

I cannot stress enough that everything as in EVERYTHING Is an insta-\"\"GET IN MY MOUTH\"\" situation! It was sophie's choice (otherwise I would have instantly put on 100lbs if I had ordered everything I wanted) but I went with the Matcha Azuki sub chocolate drizzle because it seemed like the most unique flavor. It really was incredible especially with the food top! Seriously it was amazing!!! I paired it with a green tea chai (which was INCREDIBLE) and I was one happy woman! You can definitely tell the quality of the ingredients used (especially in the chai) so I didn't mind that both my cream food and my chai came to $8 because it was not only satisfying fulfilling and delicious but everything about the vibe was worth the price tag!

The vibe gives off that alcohol bar sort of vibe but the menu is still no-frills as an standard coffee shop menu should be. It is attached to the Grove so that may shed light on why it is so uppity. You don't technically feel like you are drinking coffee and reading Faulkner at Lola Savannah but the seating is certainly comfortable. Additionally I think its nice to have a little space every once in a while. Aside from the sleek design I think the offerings in themselves are nothing noteworthy. Simplicity is what lies behind the whole concept here in my opinion. If you are passing through this area of town (is West Lake Hills technically its own town?) Lola Savannah is definitely a good place to settle down and have a cup of coffee but I don't think anything stands out in particular that would make it a better choice than any other establishment.</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 53, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5093), List()), List(sentiment, 55, 177, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5646), List()), List(sentiment, 179, 252, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5577), List()), List(sentiment, 254, 388, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5609), List()), List(sentiment, 390, 464, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4837), List()), List(sentiment, 466, 552, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4627), List()), List(sentiment, 554, 621, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4558), List()), List(sentiment, 623, 911, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5399), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>4 check-ins Vintage heart took my heart for three reasons 1.

The coffee menu has a good amount of options from regular coffee to a coffee coffee coffee and even a white coffee for those of us that want something a little sweeter. The only bad thing about this place is the parking which is basically non-existent. So if you want to stop for a quick coffee in the AM it might be a little difficult to navigate.

I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen. The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office and they made it happen. I couldn't be happier. First I appreciate the design/layout. They leased a long narrow weird-shaped old space and made it BEAUTIFUL. This is not an easy feat. I know I tried to do the same with our office location. You can tell that the design was very well thought out. Lots of warm woods excellent vibe vibe on the walls and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite. I really love the ordering area. The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee. They have pour-overs several selections of beans and grinds and (the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance) the incredible Strada coffee machine. If you are a coffee connoisseur you won't be disappointed. As for the food I am thrilled. I like to eat healthy. Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts Phonatic Hopdoddy Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives. Last time I ate at Epoch I had an incredible Vegan Club food. It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good. Most importantly the vibe there are awesome. Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team. They like great vibe they know coffee and they are extremely friendly. I am big fan and I will be in Epoch often.

Location/ vibe: It's a really really small shop. Pretty limited seating and the seatings are tiny and seating are really awkward to sit in. I came in with two other friends and we sort of sat down (two on the long seating and me on a smaller chair)- all sort of seatinged to a tiny seating. My first thought when I parkinged in was \"\"Is this it??\"\" Bc the place is just kind of a long so all the seatings and seating are all next to each other with not much space. I was glad when we came in it wasn't busy and not very packed because it'd be awkward to have strangers sit so close to you. Overall small seatings with not much seating for much. Wouldn't come here for studying or a big group. food: I came around 7 or 8pm and I don't know if they ran out throughout the day but I didn't see much food selection. It was a small display case and no more. So we moved onto the ice cream- which they had a big selection of (Both Vegan and Dairy). They let you try out the flavors with a metal spoon so don't be scared to ask! We each got a flavor (Coconut Lemon foods and the strawberry) and it was pretty good but nothing to really say \"\"YEAH THAT WAS SPECIAL I'm definitely coming back again!!\"\" I wish I had tried their coffee (now seeing really great things about their coffee ice cubes). Service: It was alright. We got served and got stamp parkingds but I don't think I'll ever come here 10 more times to fill up that parkingd. It'd have been nice if she made some recommendations to what's pretty popular in the store when she saw us squinting at the menu and looking around the shop all indecisive.

The indoor part of Irie Bean is vibe with plenty of seating and is great for work/study sessions with vibe at just the right level to blend with and drown out the steady hum of conversations but not distract you from your work. But don't miss the seating which is much larger than the inside of the coffee shop. Some vibe don't even look out the back door and they are missing out. They have tons of seatings and seating it's somewhat landscaped and they have a stage and a fun rocket ship sculpture that is so tall you can parking right through it. Kids love it and can draw on the inside with chalk. vibe bring their dogs. My only complaint is the smokers especially because they all sit and congregate right around the door going in/out of the coffee shop so there's no way to avoid them. I wish they wouldn't allow smoking out there or at least would limit it to an area that is set apart from where vibe have to parking to go in or out.\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 120, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4698), List()), List(sentiment, 122, 194, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5111), List()), List(sentiment, 196, 293, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4658), List()), List(sentiment, 295, 521, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5124), List()), List(sentiment, 523, 605, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5583), List()), List(sentiment, 607, 675, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4783), List()), List(sentiment, 677, 843, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5190), List()), List(sentiment, 845, 895, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5493), List()), List(sentiment, 897, 918, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 920, 1085, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4666), List()), List(sentiment, 1087, 1235, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4765), List()), List(sentiment, 1236, 1236, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Be it a sunny or snowy this place never fails to impress.

Those who are short on time should try their coffee coffee which is on tap thus removing the wait for them to make the expresso shots. The coffee does however have a lot of coffee so those who goes that route should be prepared for a coffee rush. In addition to coffee they also serve food foods food and food goods from other local places. I am a big fan of the lemon poppy seed food from Russell's food.

I would even go as far as to say she was downright rude. If you've never been there before it's extremely confusing and even if you're standing right in front of her she wont acknowledge you until you just tell her what you want. As you can imagine if you dont even KNOW what you want this can be frustrating. She didn't even look up at us when we quite obviously parkinged up to the counter right in front of her. The weird part about it is there wasnt a menu even posted so when I parkinged up to her I actually needed help. She didnt say one word and I just looked around until I found something that looked like a menu. That is definitely not how I want to start any day. Obviously I havent HAD coffee yet (since I'm there to receive my java fix) please dont piss me off this early... The coffee was good which gives this place one star and the vibe was nice which gives me the other 2 stars. They need to work on I dunno smiling for starters and maybe basic communication can be next on the list. Customer service would give this place a firm 4 star rating and having a menu to make this whole proc ess quick and smooth would land this place a 5 star easily but...they definitely did not do that this time.

While I do like romantic comedies lots of times I'd prefer the indie flick that hardly anyone's heard of but is so entertaining. Well Dolce Neve is a mix of both. It's not that big food shop with huge containers of food but it's also not that small shop that's a speak-easy establishment. They have almost 400 reviews and rated at 4.5 stars. That's extremely tough to do on Yelp without vibe knowing about it. We came on a hot Sunday afternoon. parking is location at the back and on the street. As I said the shop is small with about 4-5 seatings (depending on if you put them together). I was warmly greeted by both vibe working there at the time. I told them it was my first time and they happily explained their offerings. They have a good selection of food that is hand-scooped into a cup or cone. However my eyes immediately focused on their food food. My wife went with the salted parkingamel ice cream bar and I followed suit with a Stracciatella........... after my 3 flavors of food. Yes while my wife went with the incredibly delicious salted parkingamel food bar I went the traditional route and tried a cup of pistachio chocolate and salted parkingamel (recommended by the lady who helped me). While all 3 were spectacular the Stracciatella food food was calling my name. So I \"\"man'd up\"\" and got that too. =) Everything was so unbelievably fresh and comforting. I wish we had time in Austin to go back. Tip: The shop is right around the corner from the \"\"Greetings From Austin\"\" sign.

The vibe to me works. It's inviting and feels comfy. I think Epoch has set a standard for stand alone coffee shops and while this is similar in it's approach it's still unique enough to where it stands out to me. The vibe is always subtle but keeps up with the feel of the place and never overwhelmingly loud to where it's distracting. I don't know how often the vibe is changed out but it's all local vibeists and is usually pretty badass! I don't know if they cater to a theme but it's always pretty cool. The service are some of my favorite and combine the right amount of snark and sass. This obviously is vibeal preference but it feels right to me. I like some sass with my tea. Hah. It's probably cause I'm from Austin but I appreciate the myriad of non-chain coffee seating. I feel like again Epoch set the standard but all the one's I've been to seem to have their own self identifying features.

We've gone here for a couple of bluegrass concerts now. Now for the bad: * While accommodating they don't seem to parkinge to do so with a smile regardless of how I show up (with wife and kid with a friend for a alcohol with a laptop to work). This is somewhat of a systemic problem in Austin and they are only enabling the issue. * This place is only a good place to work when they want you to work - which is not after 5pm. internet shuts down at that time. (tip for Radio: you can set up multiple routers and cut internet off to 75% of the place rather than entirely - if you're goal is to focus attention on the live vibe and change the vibe) I work non-traditional hours as many do in this city but Radio seems to give zero f's about this. I will continue going here mostly because it's a great place for my family and since that seems to be how they want me to show up - to hang out/chill and not to work.

The space is fun and vibrant with color and there are seatings packed together inside. There is nothing fancy here just a converted house. There are a couple of seating to sit outside at the front and back door. On a cooler day eating outside is lovely as you can then escape the noisy banter inside. On a Sunday there is a line to the door and patience must be found as you wait 30-40 minutes after your order is placed. You place your order at the cash register and then receive a number to take with you to a seating to wait. The food is then delivered to you. seatings are first come - first serve so snag one if you are a party of two. They now serve food at Pacha until 6pm and after 11am you can select from the afternoon menu. The place is packed on the weekend and bubbly with noise of food eating patrons. Even though the place is small the selection of drink and food options to choose from is vast. Everything is local sourced and local. They make everything themselves in house - even the delicious looking deep dish pies and quiches (you can custom order one for yourself if you ask 3 days in advance). I love that they have a gluten free menu that includes French food as an option (that is rare!). The gluten free French food is delicious and the maple-pecan-espresso butter is out of this world. I didn't even need syrup. It was the perfect combination of slightly sweet meets savory. The smoothies are creamy thick and very filling. The foods can be made savory or jam packed with fruit. My husband loved the food batter but didn't find the combination of food and pear very good. Next time he will stick to the blue berry. The food bite I had was delicious. The batter is sweet moist and fluffy. I just wish they had a gluten free version. The omelets are also fresh and tasty. You can select how many foods you want and what ingredients you want inside. It is served with a slice of food (can substitute with a gluten free food). For drinks you can select from a menu of coffee tea alcohol alcohol local cider or MIMOSAS (my vibeal fave!). The local coffee they have here is superb. They make a mean coffee drink. The pacha coffee mix that they have premade and mix up with their coffee is made from soy milk and not too sweet. I highly recommend it. The mimosas are $4 and on the larger size. The parking here is very limited. There are a few seating in the back.

Don't be scared of the food shell it's actually airy enough so that when you cut into it your cream in the middle doesn't get smooshed all over the place. After you choose your food shell you pick what kind of cream you want. There are a variety of whipped creams cream food based creams custard cream and a frozen cream.

Flavors - They must put out over 20 flavors a day: mint oreo rosemary chocolate goat food and honey salted parkingamel and the list goes on! They are made fresh daily so if you go later in the day there will be more options. My vegan mother was excited she could select from the many sorbetto flavors. 2. coffee - the traditional coffee is addictive.

Stinson's is a great place to visit any time of day for good beverages (for there or to go) good food and socializing.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 60, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4837), List()), List(sentiment, 62, 144, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4839), List()), List(sentiment, 146, 207, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4618), List()), List(sentiment, 209, 302, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5450), List()), List(sentiment, 304, 549, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5636), List()), List(sentiment, 551, 612, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5558), List()), List(sentiment, 614, 656, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5881), List()), List(sentiment, 658, 766, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4740), List()), List(sentiment, 768, 843, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5610), List()), List(sentiment, 845, 898, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4924), List()), List(sentiment, 900, 967, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4660), List()), List(sentiment, 969, 991, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5619), List()), List(sentiment, 993, 1085, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5204), List()), List(sentiment, 1087, 1148, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4246), List()), List(sentiment, 1150, 1267, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5082), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Updated review 4 check-ins Listed in \"\"Nuptial Coffee Bliss!\"\" Wow it's been a year since I wrote about this place?

As befits its Westlake location this gas station is pretty ritzy all stone and arches and comes complete with drive-through coffee. But if you're not in a hurry it's worth getting out of your Escalade to check out the coffee bar inside. First of all there is a huge fish tank in the coffee area which contains some of the biggest coolest looking sea anemones I've ever seen. (I love sea anemones.) Second there is a huge covered porch out back complete with seatings seating and sofas that has a wonderful birds-eye view of the hill country. When I was there before 8am there were only a few vibe out on the porch but I was told by a friend who stopped by at around 2:30pm on a weekday afternoon that the place was packed with professional vibe on laptops and having business meetings. I would give this place more stars but was pretty disappointed in the food selection. The coffee bar had just a few standard boring food wrapped food and sad looking foods in the cooler. The food foods are horrible - dry and tasteless - and if you don't want food on them you're out of luck. Plus the only salsa available is that runny ketchup-like liquid that comes in squeeze packets. Think food Bell. When I despondently asked for four packets the clerk said - \"\"Wow you sure like things spicy!\"\" Where is he from - Mars? That crap is heresy in Austin. Never again. As for the non-coffee bar parts of the space it's pretty standard gas station fare with perhaps a slightly bigger emphasis on alcohol feminine products and boxed prepared foods than average.

The drink selection is good but I think they could offer a few more kinds of bottled alcohol. And they need to provide some more food choices especially healthy fooding foods.

Their board game selection is acceptable and I hope in the future they expand it. I also really enjoy the fact that they host so many events (best way to meet new vibe).

They charge an extra eighty cents for soy milk which is the most I've ever had to price for it but it was alright because I really enjoyed my drink! It came in a long tall glass and was mixed well although I would've hoped for a bit more of the chai flavor. They have two other seatings besides the main one where you place your order similarly vibeated. There's a single-stall bathroom that was very clean which I appreciated!

I fell for this place from the first visit. It's fabulous. I'm not from Austin but I visit regularly. I always shed a slight tear when I leave town and see Live Oak Market in my rearview mirror. I wish they had a place like this where I live: A converted convenience store that sells legitimate quality food great coffee foods food and so much more. It's a brilliant concept that makes eating healthy food good location something that a lot of vibe struggle with. They have a real grill right behind the counter and prepare food right there. All this in the space of a standard 7-Eleven. Service is oh-so-friendly and the quality of everything is great. The facility is clean and they've got a huge selection of everything including alcohols alcohols and exotic sodas ginger ales root alcohols etc. They have a vibeal items section with a wide array of natural toiletries in case you run out of aluminum free deodorant or patchouli oil (I'm talking to you hippie!). Smokers they have every pack of local natural exotic cigarette you can imagine and a variety of smoking essentials. My vibeal favorite tid-bit: It's smack dab in the parking lot of a Randall's store (in your face regular grocery store!). Seriously though I love this because it's a nice enough Randall's so if by some odd chance there's something you can't get here there's an option nearby and that particular Randall's is not the worst one around. Co-locating is a good thing in this case. There are seating and seatings out front and there are plenty of places to parking a bike with a reasonable level of security (and being able to see it) very important for me. I love this place. I love love love this place. Live Oak Market should be the model for similar stores and when you're ready to bring your concept elsewhere I'll be your first customer.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 61, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5193), List()), List(sentiment, 63, 105, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5603), List()), List(sentiment, 107, 120, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4861), List()), List(sentiment, 122, 163, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5496), List()), List(sentiment, 165, 256, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4839), List()), List(sentiment, 258, 411, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5368), List()), List(sentiment, 413, 525, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5315), List()), List(sentiment, 527, 603, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4939), List()), List(sentiment, 605, 649, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5272), List()), List(sentiment, 651, 715, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5333), List()), List(sentiment, 717, 860, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4638), List()), List(sentiment, 862, 1027, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5390), List()), List(sentiment, 1029, 1143, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4924), List()), List(sentiment, 1145, 1265, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4194), List()), List(sentiment, 1267, 1477, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5685), List()), List(sentiment, 1479, 1519, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5283), List()), List(sentiment, 1521, 1695, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5484), List()), List(sentiment, 1697, 1714, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6172), List()), List(sentiment, 1716, 1743, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6171), List()), List(sentiment, 1745, 1881, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5278), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>I don't parkinge about plaid I just want my drink...... I have been going to Buzz Mill for about 2 years now. I keep giving it another chance but I am done. The outside setting is awesome and there are some cool comedy and hours mic nights there. However their main attractions alcohol and coffee call up a bad vibe for me 2 out of 3 times. Their draft alcohol is frequently flat. For a year the alcohol out of the coolers was warm. I think they have the temperature taken parkinge of now but flat alcohol is pretty inexcusable. Lastly their coffee. The only way to spoil a good tasting coffee for me is a bad attitude. Some times at Buzz Mill I get a server who is just plain rude sometimes the server is doesn't even look up or hand me my change instead just putting it down on the counter and turns away. This time I was told my 2 coffee would take 10 minutes. I stepped outside for 5 min. When I returned my coffee were set to the side un marked and mixed up. When I asked about it the server said \"\"They were sitting there for a long time so I moved them. I'm not sure which one is which.\"\" This kind of service isn't \"\"cool\"\" or \"\"hipster\"\" its just bad. It keeps me from spending money there. That sounds like a bad business to me.

The Pita food that came with it was as it should be. I sampled two kinds of rice...I believe it said it was Long grain basmati rice seasoned with turmeric & another type of rice with butter.

Despite of the interesting concept and the perfect food Sa-Ten is unfortunately marred by its high price. My drink of choice was the signature Ohayo the brown sugar coffee named as \"\"good morning\"\" in Japanese. At a standard size of $4.50 Ohayo would be good if it were labeled as a regular coffee but the interesting concept of a brown sugar coffee did not distinguish itself from its taste. The sriracha mayo smoked salmon food was a flavorful delight with food food topped with small pieces of smoked salmon but the price of $7.99 was staggering. The vibe and the service were top-notch and the outdoor plaza seating makes it a good place for a hangout in a good weather.

A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift and since then the service at food has declined sharply. The guy who used to run the counter at food was cheerful courteous and FAST. There were plenty of all the different types of foods wrapped and ready to go and I could grab my coffee choose my foods price and leave in less than five minutes usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet. The first time I went since that guy left there were two new guys one running the counter and the other preparing the foods. Both of the kinds I usually get weren't ready and the food prepper took a while to make the foods then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready. I stood there for several minutes until the service noticed the bag sitting there even after I told him they were ready and had been set down. The last time I went there there was only one customer ahead of me in line who looked tense and irate waiting for the same \"\"taco prepper\"\" guy from the previous time to fix his foods (he usually wears a bandana on his head). This time he was also running the register. I got my coffee waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid. The guy came and took my order started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my foods. Then he asked me if I was okay (I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed) and I told him I was just in a rush. Then he loudly said that they're never in a rush at Live Oak Market and I told him that they used to be and that I used to be able to get my order quickly. He told me to have a nice day and I left. I've worked in customer service for years including working as a service at a busy coffee shop and I find the notion that \"\"rushing\"\" during what is known as \"\"rush hours\"\" on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable. The primary reason vibe stop there is because yes the foods are good and so is the coffee supporting local businesses is important AND because you can jump out of your parking grab your food and coffee and get back on the road in five minutes or less (or you should be able to rather). If you're not prepared to \"\"rush\"\" between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. on a weekday and you're service food and coffee then you're in the wrong business. Luckily a family owned food truck hoursed directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot. Their foods are less bad price taste much better the service is friendly and they're always ready when you get there. So no more Live Oak for me in the mornings. I make my own coffee and get foods across the street. (During the rest of the day the service is great and I still love the store in general but I hope they replace their early morning service.)\"</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 44, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4593), List()), List(sentiment, 46, 131, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4775), List()), List(sentiment, 133, 252, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 254, 329, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4543), List()), List(sentiment, 331, 568, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4788), List()), List(sentiment, 570, 693, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4752), List()), List(sentiment, 695, 900, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5175), List()), List(sentiment, 902, 1043, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4705), List()), List(sentiment, 1045, 1269, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4500), List()), List(sentiment, 1271, 1313, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4498), List()), List(sentiment, 1315, 1407, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4686), List()), List(sentiment, 1409, 1495, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4980), List()), List(sentiment, 1497, 1613, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4745), List()), List(sentiment, 1615, 1769, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4751), List()), List(sentiment, 1771, 1811, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4876), List()), List(sentiment, 1813, 2033, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5667), List()), List(sentiment, 2035, 2319, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5747), List()), List(sentiment, 2321, 2471, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5321), List()), List(sentiment, 2473, 2592, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4713), List()), List(sentiment, 2594, 2710, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4904), List()), List(sentiment, 2712, 2754, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4682), List()), List(sentiment, 2756, 2808, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5450), List()), List(sentiment, 2810, 2950, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6488), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Delightful (and highly caffeinated) service & equally delightful outdoor seating.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 80, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4875), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>I love this place!

What a place appropriate for Austin! Their menu covers foods coffee smoothies food foods and foods. Seriously all food places should have a sampler dish available! Their foods looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige food with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries. Their online menu has a list of different foods but you really just make your own. First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small. Don't worry it isn't. I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh. The food was a bit dense for me so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it. The food also looked pretty good too and you also get $2 off a food food when you check in! Missed out on their food Pops too so another excuse to come back. There's only one or two cooks so the food will take a while to come out. Make sure you're not in a rush. I was the last of a group of 8 to order and my food took about 30 minutes.

It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for \"\"the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town\"\". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point we stopped in for a bit. It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter light it for you and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece so make sure you savor every bite! I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh. Well that minor detail aside I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire.\"</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 58, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5157), List()), List(sentiment, 60, 148, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4797), List()), List(sentiment, 150, 280, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4462), List()), List(sentiment, 282, 363, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4790), List()), List(sentiment, 365, 437, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4629), List()), List(sentiment, 439, 532, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5198), List()), List(sentiment, 534, 537, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7145), List()), List(sentiment, 539, 575, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5409), List()), List(sentiment, 577, 660, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4355), List()), List(sentiment, 662, 703, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5577), List()), List(sentiment, 705, 824, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4631), List()), List(sentiment, 826, 916, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5200), List()), List(sentiment, 918, 1025, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4746), List()), List(sentiment, 1027, 1033, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1035, 1177, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4785), List()), List(sentiment, 1178, 1178, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Disappointed that they ran out of french food when we went but their food was very delicious - a must have! food food w sausage and food - amazing</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 106, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4190), List()), List(sentiment, 108, 145, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4562), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>It's got an iconic wall a trendy location and the drinks totally matched!

It took me about 10 minutes to load this page and I'm staring at dimly lit Adventure Time-styled coffee shop vibe while waiting. I can see this as a good place to meet and catch up with vibe though. The dimness and louder vibe makes this place better for conversations. Plus the large window facing Congress makes it great for vibe watching. I have an entertaining view of poor souls being snatched up by the suspiciously friendly Save the Children vibe out on the streets. Also getting some great fashion inspiration. There's a larger selection of food and food foods than before and the coffee is still OK.

The space itself is aesthetically pleasing and it is very good location to me within parking distance. I have never been crazy about their coffee but the food goods can be quite delicious. Unfortunately the customer service is dreadful. On numerous occasions I have parkinged in to find no one manning the counter and on other occasions the caliber of the vibe manning the counter seemed sub par. Mostly I get the impression they would rather be doing something else. Today was the final straw when I stood in line for over 10 minutes while the counter vibe parkingried on a vibeal conversation about her parkingeer aspirations with a customer while I stood there waiting. I do realize you can't be rude to vibe but she encouraged and extended the conversation without regard. This lack of concern over the customer vibe seems to trickle down from management since I have vibed it with multiple vibe at this facility including management. Starbucks in contrast has consistent vibenel plenty of serviceing and a genuine concern for vibeal service.

Or maybe I do? I have been asking myself that lately? All I know is that I am very parkingeful about trying things I love. Because once I tasted the \"\"Premo\"\" I have a REAL hard time settling for anything less. For example a few years ago I went in to Andersons bought an AEROPRESS (Awesome!) and a pound of beans. Went home and experimented with my new coffee pump and I had cup after cup of the best coffee of my life. I called my wife tweaking out on coffee \"\"OH MY GOODNESS THIS COFFEE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!! AHHHWWW I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS COFFEE IS BAWWWAAAHHH!!!\"\" Now 3 years have passed by and I have this to say. The Aeropress is mind blowing. I always order an coffee when I am buying a cup of coffee from a local establishment and I have had maybe three cups that are in the same dimension as what I can get out of that AEROPRESS. Absolutely amazing! While I used to think that it was the AEROPRESS that made any coffee amazing I have learned that the AEROPRESS can only bring coffee to its full potential. I have tried coffee beans from many places and NO BODY has coffee like Andersons. It is so good that I will be at the grocery store standing in front of the Coffee completely out at home and my eyes will be swelling up with tears looking at the sorry ass beans. Looking and looking at all of the sorry bags of coffee. I used to really like some of the more bad price bags but they all fall way short of Andersons. So I tell myself \"\"SELF if you buy coffee here you wont make a point to stop by andersons and every time you make a cup with theses crappy beans you will disappointed. Go with out and get to Andersons ASAP.\"\" So that is what I do. I love Andersons coffee so much that I will go without coffee for several days until I can get the good stuff. I love coffee but now that I can have the best that is what I want. The best or bust. If there is better coffee out there I will try it. Trust me I am looking!

I really like this cafe. However today we had a terrible vibe. I came with a friend with a service dog (tagged as service animal) Two separate service told her she couldn't bring a dog in. She explained that it was a service animal. First service wasn't comfortable but accepted it. The second service came over and told us to leave or go out on the seating. When informed that it was a service dog he loudly asked her what her disability was. I pulled him aside and informed him that it's not a legal question to ask. He rolled his eyes. Then said well vibe see the dog and want to bring their dogs in. I told him it's not cool to ask that. He said \"\"it's not cool to bring a dog in here\"\" After that we got the cold shoulder from the service. While I love this cafe unless things are going to change and service are informed on how to handle this situation I'll have to go elsewhere to spend a small fortune in coffee. \"\"Commonly Asked Questions about Service Animals in Places of Business\"\" US gov link: ada.gov/qasrvc.htm\"</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 47, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4744), List()), List(sentiment, 49, 72, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5613), List()), List(sentiment, 74, 110, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5113), List()), List(sentiment, 112, 236, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4656), List()), List(sentiment, 238, 280, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4851), List()), List(sentiment, 282, 330, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5289), List()), List(sentiment, 332, 406, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5229), List()), List(sentiment, 408, 491, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4910), List()), List(sentiment, 493, 566, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4839), List()), List(sentiment, 568, 586, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5260), List()), List(sentiment, 588, 651, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5271), List()), List(sentiment, 653, 689, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4821), List()), List(sentiment, 691, 792, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4604), List()), List(sentiment, 794, 968, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5866), List()), List(sentiment, 970, 1074, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6462), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Listed in Texas 2016 Reviews ATX Hangout seating When in need of coffee...

The ice cream is particularly delicious. The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams. For the coffee lover their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the service have great expertise in their craft.

The idea that this coffee shop is hours 24 hours massively appeals to me. I have an abnormal sleep schedule and having a coffee shop accessible when I want it is amazing to me. Two downsides: parking and seating. These two things are the reasons why they didn't get five stars from me. parking is very limited and the entrance is coffee causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper. If you go during peak hours there will be zero seating. Other than these two items their price for their drinks and food are good price. If there is one thing that will make San Antonio better a 24/7 coffee shop is a MUST.

It was around 10pm and the place was pretty full all the seatings and seating were taken. After reviewing the options the server recommended I try some flavors including vanilla basil and chocolate orange. It was like a flavorful party in my mouth! I was also told that they partner with local farms and shops so much of the flavors change according to what items are in season and fresh. I tried the two flavors together and it was so delicious. Creamy consistency and lasted for 20 mins without melting to soup. Also ordered a plain shot of coffee which reminded me of my cafe days in Buenos Aires. *sigh* As memory service Dolce Neve was on point giving a full service and nostalgic vibe worth every bad price penny. I was lucky to get a seating and seating before a huge line of vibe came in. Space is limited so if you come with a group of four or more keep that in mind. There is some sitting outside on the porch but during the winter months probably left for the heartiest of folks.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 220, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5285), List()), List(sentiment, 222, 371, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4574), List()), List(sentiment, 373, 461, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5278), List()), List(sentiment, 463, 577, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5438), List()), List(sentiment, 579, 620, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6552), List()), List(sentiment, 622, 760, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4570), List()), List(sentiment, 762, 818, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5545), List()), List(sentiment, 820, 885, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4885), List()), List(sentiment, 887, 972, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5171), List()), List(sentiment, 974, 1091, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5423), List()), List(sentiment, 1093, 1168, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5433), List()), List(sentiment, 1170, 1248, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5189), List()), List(sentiment, 1250, 1362, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5467), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Updated review 2 check-ins I was literally in love with this place. I had admired their selection and vibe. My last vibe white washed all of it. The male service was so rude and that you could feel it in his tone. His words we sharp n pinching. I received a response from him and that too was full of arrogance!! I respect rules and policies of the businesses but there is something called as customer service and politeness which is almost non existent here..Never gonna go back and will stop recommending this place :( My previous review: Ok... M confused !!! I was in Love with this place Coz of amazing tastes excellent interiors & vibe and great customer service. The couple who manages the place (I thought were amazing). I actually love the lady she has excellent customer service skills so polite and great. But today I had a bad vibe. I was so happy to take one of my friend who was visiting me to a great food place. Yeah I understand it's Saturday they have many vibe but it doesn't mean the male would be rude .. Very rude. As I stepped in they were few groups before me. They went ahead tried the ice cream and they were being served by the lady .. She was cheerful polite & nice. Since there were couple of vibe so they male guy took over the service. As my turn arrived .. He was rude and said u can only try 2 flavors.. That's ok. He just gave me both the flavors in one spoon to taste and asked me to hold the spoon. And even told my friend u decide n keep what u want. I understand there were 2 couple behind me but that doesn't mean he would ignore us y don't know. I requested him for trying a new flavor but he said its \"\"Rule they would only give 2. But we saw vibe before us were given whatever they wanted to try. I am feeling embarrassed my friend felt so bad the way he behaved and talked with us. I respect their policies & rules but then it should be the same for all vibe. parking is a pain since only 6-7 seating...

It used to be one of my favorite coffee shops in all of Austin but I've grown increasingly agitated with the establishment. I order the same drink religiously and I never deviate from it. While looking at my bank statement I noticed that I have paid the same price 14 times for my go to drink but I have also paid different price ranging from 3-5 dollars for the same drink 12 times. I have brought it up with the service and they shrug it off and attribute it to the casualness of the East Side of Austin. I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me a Black woman about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified. I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population. I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for vibe who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black vibe in the seating or that everyone else is white like them. This place is for you if you too like to gentrify areas where deeply rooted cultures of African Americans have been established for generations. This place is for you if you are audacious enough to recreate and redefine the culture of East Austin and tell a vibe from there what it is. Lastly this place is for you if you like to commodify poverty to look cool and eccentric...or of course \"\"hipster\"\" Needless to say this will be my last visit.

The little trailer is absolutely ADORABLE and the fact that you actually go inside it to order is fun. Everything tastes fresh; it was also nice that I could get my coffee made with almond milk. Yay!

Epoch Coffee is a vibe but vibe coffee shop hours 24/7 (a dream come true if like us you like to stay up late!) They serve great coffee coffee a killer coffee soda tea delicious pies food bagels and East Side Pies pizza slices. They have a large indoor and outdoor space free wi-fi access and lots of seatings and seating for all. Many vibe visit Epoch Coffee night and day to work or study on their laptops while sipping on a flavorful coffee. My husband and I usually go there to chitchat and relax which seems to be counter-current to the local working-hard-with-my-coffee culture but we feel welcome in the space nonetheless.

What I've tried: - Salted parkingamel Iced Coffee (2/5): I always order salted parkingamel at every coffee shop if they have the option but this was mainly syrup not so much coffee. I probably wouldn't order coffee here again. - Peanut Butter Pig (4/5): Yum! Banana stuffed food topped with peanut butter sliced food (!!) and sliced bananas - Berry Mary (5/5): I was told that vibe order this the most and I can definitely see why! This is blueberry stuffed food topped with sweetened cream food and sliced strawberries They make everything in-house and the foods on the spot which is a-awesome! I'm definitely going back to try the food pops because what's a better food in this hot Texas weather? There's a private lot out in front so you won't have to worry about parking and plenty of seating inside (plus internet!)

I love the vibe. I love their coffee and delectable treats. It took me a while to find it but will never leave now that I'm here. Honestly I bring my own coffee everywhere I go now. Only 2 restaurants in Austin serve coffee good enough for my taste so I bring my Anderson's roasts with me everywhere. I vibeally stick to decafs and have tried 3 different varieties. The French roast is a staple favorite. The Sumoan was really good as well. The House blend I didn't find as dark roasted as I like my coffee. But honestly other than vibeal preference there isn't a single coffee not worth it's weight. The parking lot can get hectic at times but I can always find a space on the street or in the lot eventually. The vibe here are fantastic. Very laid back and helpful. Just try one of the two coffee they have coffeeed on the counter or ask about one on the board. Specify how much and what type of filter you use. And if you need it ground or not. Takes no more than 10 min even when it's busy. Oh and I hate sharing which treats are my favorite but I promise you can't go wrong for a food or gift for a chocolate and coffee lover.

It's 3 parts fresh-roasted coffee 1 part lichen and 1 part poop. Your guess is as good as mine. I really don't parkinge though since this place has the best value in to-go coffee that I've seen in the city. A 12 oz cup of Starbucks costs $1.50 I believe; Whole Foods and Central Market costs closer to $2. At Anderson's a to-go cup of coffee costs $1 even and it's better than most of the coffee at the above-mentioned places. Supposedly their in-house roasted coffee is an even better value but I have yet to buy it because my piece-of-crap coffeemaker couldn't really do it justice. Someday... The quaint but attractive shop is location near the original Kerbey Lane which sometimes makes it challenging to find parking. But I promise the effort is worth it.

I normally get coffee here and they are hot not too sweet and delicious. The coffee are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass) the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone food which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each but I think their vendor went out of business....? The foods are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea.

For example Pride and Prejudice Moby Dick Scarlet Letter. Even just their regular house coffeeed coffee taste great! My top two drinks I order is the regular hot coffee and regular ice coffee with hazel nut syrup! Third the interior design and vibe is perfect for a chill hangout casual date or just to go study. There are a bunch of seatings and seating. However every time I got there it's always packed so you kind of have to fight for your seating. If you smoke or just love nature they have outdoor seatings too with cute lights hanging outside. Overall I love this place and definitely recommend! ACAI smoothie!

Luckily I dig deeper than just viewing the cover of books and have come to realize that this place is all food and no meat. (is that a cliche?) The food is ok. The service is ok. The coffee is ok. There are always 3-4 vibe behind the counter and they definitely parkinge more about their conversations than their vibe. It's not a bad thing but it definitely doesn't feel like you're being greeted by your neighbor. More like your neighbors kid who just got back from their first semester at college.

It was about 95 degrees outside so she just assumed that it would come chilled. I told her to ask them to exchange it for a chilled glass.. No big deal right? Wrong. They made a huge deal about how she should be more specific and in the end refused to swap it out for her. She's a sweet girl and non confrontational. I ended up having to go inside and talk to the service to at least give her a glass of ice so she didn't have to drink a hot beverage on an already sweltering Texas night.

I liked their crushed iced and the almond milk was nice and creamy although I wish the coffee would have come through a bit stronger - I could've used an extra shot. The vibe was nice as its in a renovated old home making it feel very welcoming. My two biggest reasons it didn't get 4 stars: the vibe they were playing happened to be a fiddler or some type of instrument that without even being particularly loud seemed to cut through my headphones no matter how loud I turned my own vibe. Didn't love that. Secondly I thought that the $5.10 price for my coffee was a bit coffee- I get it it's Austin but I've had better almond milk coffee for slightly good priceer elsewhere.

I saw many vibe with mugs but I also think I read a review about someone using their own cup so I don't know if these vibe brought their own mugs or if they just didn't have anymore or what. It took everything in me not to ask them to pour my drink into a mug. I didn't because I would have felt stupid but I wanted to. I know it's dumb but it bothered me a little.

We ended up stuck at the front of a line of traffic waiting for a gap in the pain parade for an hours and a half. He-Man and cousin made water in the bushes while I tromped straight up to one of the location houses and asked to use the bathroom like a human being and a woman who doesn't like to bare her ass for a line of traffic. Anywhooooooo...a gap finally hoursed up and we sped off. As the hours wore on I became painfully aware of my growing coffee deprivation and subsequent headache. We ended up parking near location at the Mexican American Cultural Center where He-Man emptied his stomach in front of a high school kid he used to coach. So that was great. Having given up on the rest of our cheering stations we made our way toward location. It was at the corner of Congress and 4th Street that the cousin and I turned away for a second...and when we turned back He-Man had disappeared. At that point a few other vibe joined us but I was the only vibe among the group who was concerned about my friend He-Man who in my imagination had already fallen on a cop. The group halfheartedly searched for a couple of blocks and then we all decided it was time to sit down. Voila! A gorilla in the mist! Hideout Coffeehouse! How is it that I had never seen or heard of this place before? Must have something to do with the name. Tucked away in its own little corner the place had exactly what we needed: coffee alcohol and a multitude of food. We sat near the front at tiny copper seatings which are exactly the right size for a laptop. Semi-dark interior local vibe big windows vibe that doesn't deafen you and cool service. A great end to a marathon of a day. He-Man eventually found us and so did our newly-medaled friends. So maybe it's a great place to tuck away and get some work done in a low-profile vibe but I wouldn't use it to you know hide from the police or anything.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 33, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5278), List()), List(sentiment, 34, 34, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 35, 35, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 36, 67, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4728), List()), List(sentiment, 69, 134, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5307), List()), List(sentiment, 136, 283, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5570), List()), List(sentiment, 285, 310, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5255), List()), List(sentiment, 311, 311, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 312, 312, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 313, 333, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4875), List()), List(sentiment, 335, 341, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5186), List()), List(sentiment, 343, 422, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5574), List()), List(sentiment, 424, 519, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6535), List()), List(sentiment, 521, 606, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5199), List()), List(sentiment, 608, 696, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4556), List()), List(sentiment, 698, 734, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5476), List()), List(sentiment, 735, 735, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 736, 736, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 737, 813, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5397), List()), List(sentiment, 815, 927, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5319), List()), List(sentiment, 929, 1145, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5404), List()), List(sentiment, 1147, 1159, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1160, 1160, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1161, 1161, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1162, 1202, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5165), List()), List(sentiment, 1204, 1306, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5546), List()), List(sentiment, 1308, 1461, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4786), List()), List(sentiment, 1463, 1480, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5451), List()), List(sentiment, 1482, 1566, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4681), List()), List(sentiment, 1568, 1662, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5546), List()), List(sentiment, 1663, 1663, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1664, 1664, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1665, 1711, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4938), List()), List(sentiment, 1713, 1884, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5690), List()), List(sentiment, 1886, 1989, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4758), List()), List(sentiment, 1991, 1996, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7145), List()), List(sentiment, 1998, 2019, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6245), List()), List(sentiment, 2021, 2040, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7145), List()), List(sentiment, 2042, 2103, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4452), List()), List(sentiment, 2105, 2144, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4853), List()), List(sentiment, 2146, 2259, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5192), List()), List(sentiment, 2261, 2352, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5475), List()), List(sentiment, 2354, 2441, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4897), List()), List(sentiment, 2443, 2477, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5095), List()), List(sentiment, 2479, 2542, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4902), List()), List(sentiment, 2544, 2696, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5089), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Very good coffee fine food (nowhere near spectacular- go further south for the best) delicious smelling foods and oddly frazzled rude service.

There was one customer inside dining and myself and 3 friends stopped in--- so no need to be rushed or attend to the flood of vibe. The 2 'new' service members welcomed us and we began asking questions about food flavors. The vibe in charge interrupts to ask how she can help us (strange we're being helped) and told us to come over to her and she would help us (also strange). The service member helping us with flavors handed me a sample and then the vibe in charge stepped in to say that she gave me the wrong flavor and barked orders to the service member that had been helping me. The 2 service members scurried off to complete their tasks. It was a very strange vibe. I wish I had recorded it to get a full script of the interactions. The shop was not busy nothing was wrong to the vibe and no one was upset and the vibe in charge was publicly degrading to her service members working that morning. ' Seems to be a good place to get coffee. As for food I wouldn't get it here unless someone I was with demanded food immediately and that was the only near place.

Genuine coffee is a quaint and vibe coffee shop location on West Anderson. There's ample parking when you pull into the lot and the interior is...simple (in a good way).There's a lot of seatings seating and couch seating. The furniture looks like it was all claimed for free off of Craigslist. Nothing matches and most of the furniture is different yet this isn't off-putting at all. Everything just works. There's a few different seatings and an outdoor seating. The vibe isn't loud and overbearing. The vibe is pretty laid back and I'd feel comfortable coming here to meet with friends or to get some work done/keep to myself. I felt a little warm when I was here but it could just be me. The service are pretty friendly. They'll parkingry on a conversation with you as they make your drink but they aren't going to force anything with you either.They prefer you use parkingd for purchases over $5 but I assume it's perfectly okay to use your parkingd below that amount. GJ offers a 5% discount if you use cash. The menu offers a diversity of drinks and the beverages aren't bad price. I enjoyed my chai coffee and I definitely want to come back to try their specialty drinks. Overall I enjoyed Genuine coffee. It's a simple no frills coffee shop that offers great drinks a pleasing vibe and wi-fi that actually works.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 46, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5154), List()), List(sentiment, 48, 121, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5160), List()), List(sentiment, 123, 191, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5339), List()), List(sentiment, 192, 192, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 193, 193, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 194, 216, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5605), List()), List(sentiment, 217, 268, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5210), List()), List(sentiment, 270, 340, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5714), List()), List(sentiment, 342, 430, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5401), List()), List(sentiment, 432, 453, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5439), List()), List(sentiment, 455, 510, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4912), List()), List(sentiment, 512, 547, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5454), List()), List(sentiment, 549, 675, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5261), List()), List(sentiment, 677, 737, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4771), List()), List(sentiment, 739, 770, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5347), List()), List(sentiment, 772, 1019, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5216), List()), List(sentiment, 1021, 1060, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5), List()), List(sentiment, 1062, 1134, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4794), List()), List(sentiment, 1136, 1225, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5251), List()), List(sentiment, 1227, 1259, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5347), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1367, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4984), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>3 check-ins Best parkingamel coffee in town!

They have coffee alcohol and alcohol selections. There's a nice indoor sitting area but the real winner is the outdoor covered seating area with a gorgeous view. Pictures just don't do it justice. There are plenty of seatings & seating 2 couches and 2 flat screen tvs and the vibe is simple but dignified. It's a great spot to stop and smell the roses - seriously the view just makes you happy.

It has a nice balance doesn't taste like tea or burnt. And of course it's great that they have alcohol.

They also serve a good selection of alcohol and a bit of food from local places. Cuvee is a great local roaster and you can be confident that you're tasting a well-roasted coffee whatever type you get. Nothing charred or food. There are lots of good local roasters but Cuvee is a sure bet. If you coffee at home you'll want to try their beans. I usually get a pour-over but their coffee is great too.

There's also free internet which is a definite plus for a college student such as myself. I can definitely see myself working or studying there as the vibe is really chill and the service is super nice and relatable! It was the middle of the day on a weekday so limited seating may sometimes be a problem but it wasn't for us. Waiting for the food didn't take long either. Now to the real details. The pear food was incredible! It was huge and amazingly fluffy and literally melted in my mouth and the pear addition to the flavor was so delicious. I'd never had anything like it even compared to Kerbey Lane though I've never tried foods at Magnolia Cafe. I love that they use fresh local ingredients at Pacha! It makes me feel a little less guilty about loving food food. The sausage foods and potatoes were cooked so nicely and the platter was really filling so I think it's worth the money. Didn't try the coffee there today but I will definitely be back soon to do so! Cannot wait to come back and try all the different food flavors and probably the omelettes too. Would surely recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately price food place that is super yummy.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 43, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7316), List()), List(sentiment, 45, 140, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5511), List()), List(sentiment, 142, 239, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5404), List()), List(sentiment, 241, 329, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5567), List()), List(sentiment, 331, 456, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4072), List()), List(sentiment, 458, 566, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5490), List()), List(sentiment, 568, 612, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4523), List()), List(sentiment, 614, 637, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4658), List()), List(sentiment, 639, 667, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6739), List()), List(sentiment, 669, 787, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5344), List()), List(sentiment, 789, 895, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5224), List()), List(sentiment, 897, 950, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7327), List()), List(sentiment, 952, 1012, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5360), List()), List(sentiment, 1014, 1133, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4487), List()), List(sentiment, 1135, 1212, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6048), List()), List(sentiment, 1214, 1308, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5243), List()), List(sentiment, 1310, 1409, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5342), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Listed in Austin coffee + Wi-fi + Workspace coffee: excellent!

It's a super casual place that has a awesome seating that we will frequent once it cools down. They also have a super friendly service. But the real reason you go to a place is because things taste good and service is good right... OK I'll get to it then. I had the Persian Lamb food and Lavender Lemonade. Hubs had the food Havarti. All were big winners but the Lamb sammie was sooo great. My hubs is from Iceland where lamb is serious business and I wasn't expecting awesome but it really was just that- completely awesome. Fresh tomato and a flavorful sauce was on top (be warned it is messy but worth a good stain or two). The Lemonade was very sweet but it was a great twist with the lavender and wasn't overdone (it could have tasted like soap but instead it was just super refreshing). Well done Mama!

The BIEN-nu: + Their Bennu Coffee coffee Menu is perfect for those nights where you need a cocktail of sugar & coffee to keep you running. They're wonderfully decadent and the flavors are super...novel. Turn down the white & dark chocolate sugar explosion of the Great Gatsby? You...Scott to be kidding me. The Oliver Twist? You better have some Great Expectations for this parkingamel & chocolate medley of deliciousness. & I am not Dicken(s) around with you. + It's hours 24 hours. Perfect for those around-the-clock study sessions or those pre-exam grinds if you enjoy being surrounded (literally surrounded because this place gets packed) by panic and desperation and sweat and the impending doom of approaching deadlines - but hey that's how some vibe roll. + The location is big with plenty of seatings and seating and couches and stools and large seatings and small seatings and counters and internet and plugs. Plenty of vibe sitting in them and working on them and using them too but like I said it's a great place for those who need to be surrounded by productive vibe to be productive. The Ben-NO-NO: + Mostly vibe complaints but in my world this means the universe (HA): too vibeed bad vibe & too dark. True story: I remember reading my textbook (probably with my iPhone flashlight) and then jamming out to Avril Lavigne and then I was like wait a second stop it Avril I'm trying to study and you're making it Complicated (actually it was Sk8r Boi). If you're doing work solely on your computer and you've got your headphones in - basically if you are a computer science major (working with...java) - you'll be solid. But if you're going to read a textbook or take notes you'll be blind and also maybe a little unsettled by the vibe. + It's not very clean and the furniture looks like it just won a really difficult fight - it's sort of like studying in your grandma's attic which is cool I guess. Actually I appreciate the mismatched old worn-out furniture attic look - I just don't particularly like studying in it. Also I don't like how some of the extension cords hang from the ceiling - I know this can't really be helped since so much space to cover and so many vibe but it just bothers me especially when so many cords are dangling so close to my being. Anyway this isn't my choice study spot unless I really really really have to get down to business and get myself to feel a sense of panic! Which I guess is often. (Honestly I probably should have gone tonight...) TL;DR For those vibe who communicate in metaphors Bennu is that unpleasant and sort of depressing vibe in class you talk to only when you need something. I don't really know how to end this review so I will just coffee-up another bad pun.</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 101, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4860), List()), List(sentiment, 103, 240, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5482), List()), List(sentiment, 242, 296, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4853), List()), List(sentiment, 297, 297, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 298, 298, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 299, 304, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5139), List()), List(sentiment, 306, 378, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4369), List()), List(sentiment, 380, 383, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4903), List()), List(sentiment, 384, 384, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 385, 385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 386, 408, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5213), List()), List(sentiment, 410, 426, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4), List()), List(sentiment, 428, 524, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5186), List()), List(sentiment, 526, 542, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5732), List()), List(sentiment, 543, 562, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5427), List()), List(sentiment, 564, 585, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 587, 864, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5270), List()), List(sentiment, 866, 1020, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4822), List()), List(sentiment, 1022, 1198, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 1200, 1316, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5331), List()), List(sentiment, 1318, 1563, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5526), List()), List(sentiment, 1565, 1731, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5031), List()), List(sentiment, 1733, 1847, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4864), List()), List(sentiment, 1849, 2011, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5583), List()), List(sentiment, 2013, 2131, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4680), List()), List(sentiment, 2133, 2374, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5561), List()), List(sentiment, 2376, 2513, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5506), List()), List(sentiment, 2515, 2537, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5597), List()), List(sentiment, 2539, 2591, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3814), List()), List(sentiment, 2592, 2741, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4849), List()), List(sentiment, 2743, 2826, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5127), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>Their turkey cran food will make you slap your mother for not making thanksgiving taste that good.

This is as Appalachian as it gets in Austin. The vibe inside resembles a lumberjacks cabin adorned with a raw wood bar bear vibe and rustic intimate seatings.

The stage often hosts vibeal acts or BuzzKill comedy every Wednesday but you can escape the noise if you want a vibe night on the side of the building or past the back bar. Hip bulb lights and a fire pit light up the space and allow clear visibility even on the darkest night. Cuisine: There are how I see it four options to eat at Buzzmill. All are good options. 1. There is a randomly hoursed food truck that service mostly burgers but also Sunday food. 2. There is 1776 foodsteak that I should write a separate review about since it's so good and authentic. 3. There is a small selection of food and healthier items in a cooler inside. 4. There is tons of alcohol for those on a liquid grain diet. Service: The line to the bar can get a bit long but I believe the new bar system and the addition of the outside bar will alleviate this issue on even the busiest nights.

The currant sells out often. I can recommend the cranberry scone and the rosemary/cheddar scone. It's moist yet flakey. The tea selection here is extensive and it really depends on your taste. My only complaint about this place is---I believe that clotted cream should really be served at seating temperature. They serve it cold here and its incredibly hard to spread without breaking the scone. There tea food are awesome and you can do it with crust off!

I have been in Austin since September and it has been on to do list. So let us start with the entrance when I parkinged in I had no clue that there was even a hostess. She was standing behind a half wall I went to the counter to look at the menu and the lady behind the counter asked if I was ordering to go. I informed her that I actually wanted to eat in and she pointed me to the \"\"hostess\"\". She just stared at me until I said \"\"just 1\"\". She informs me that there was a 15 to 20 minute wait; even though there were hours seatings and only two vibe ahead of me. She informed me that the \"\" lounges\"\" was hours sitting but was not served by a server. I was informed that I would need to order at the counter and serve myself. I had planned to do that from the start!!! The young man behind the counter was very helpful. I selected the Buddha Bowl with collard greens red rice sweet potatoes and white beans. I was NOT expecting for it to taste like it did. There was absolutely NO seasoning on any of the items in the bowl. It tasted like they just boiled the items in water and then stuck them in a bowl. I selected the sesame lime sauce for the bowl it had weird taste to it. I kept telling myself while eating \"\"you eat for fuel not taste\"\". The only part of my food that I actually enjoyed was my pot of Jasmine tea. If I ever go back it will only be for tea because what I vibed of the food was a waste if time. I am only giving it 3 stars because of the guy behind the counter; I think his name was Ravi and the pot of tea.\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 27, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5367), List()), List(sentiment, 29, 96, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4857), List()), List(sentiment, 98, 195, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5279), List()), List(sentiment, 197, 336, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5513), List()), List(sentiment, 338, 470, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4435), List()), List(sentiment, 472, 524, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4673), List()), List(sentiment, 526, 593, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5539), List()), List(sentiment, 595, 681, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4541), List()), List(sentiment, 683, 756, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5635), List()), List(sentiment, 758, 799, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6033), List()), List(sentiment, 801, 850, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5616), List()), List(sentiment, 852, 938, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4709), List()), List(sentiment, 940, 987, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4647), List()), List(sentiment, 989, 1054, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4812), List()), List(sentiment, 1056, 1136, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5179), List()), List(sentiment, 1138, 1208, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4520), List()), List(sentiment, 1210, 1275, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4180), List()), List(sentiment, 1277, 1351, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4387), List()), List(sentiment, 1353, 1447, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4664), List()), List(sentiment, 1449, 1514, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4338), List()), List(sentiment, 1516, 1560, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4624), List()), List(sentiment, 1561, 1561, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>This place is awesome!!

I ordered hot coffee with creamer and toffee syrup as well as the Italian food. The food was VERY good. As someone who is not a crazy fan of food or donuts I liked the variety of the menu. If you're in the mood for some savory food you will definitely find it here. The service also were very friendly when I ordered my food. Speaking of ordering - you can also sit down at a seating and scan a QR code to text your order! It might not seem like a big deal but I am deaf so anything like this definitely helps to faciliate communication for better service. I would definitely say this place is \"\"deaf friendly\"\" just because of that.

I've been in Austin a month and been working from as many coffee shops as possible. For me the difference lies in the details. Helpful service who are happy to have a conversation simple syrup and chocolate powder at the sugar station ubiquitous new wall internet nice dark wood seatings that don't wobble. (Of course I haven't checked all the seatings but I did just see a girl check one's stability- it met her sturdiness standards so she took a seating.) It looks like they may have taken notice of the reviewer who complained about thin wooden seating as they now have sturdy functional metal ones and a comfy leather-padded bench against the back wall. They currently have a large projector screen showing the Tour de France on mute (they do share space with a bike shop but there's been no problem with noise or hustle bustle). Not sure if that's a regular thing but if it's on and you want to ignore it you can face squarely away from it at any of the seatings. The only issue I had was that WiFi was down when I arrived. Mistakes happen but it's how you resolve the problem that matters. I brought up the problem and it was fixed in no time. I suggested that they add a password to the router so the neighbors might stop overloading it; we'll see if they take that advice. The best testament to how much I like the place is that this is my first Yelp review. I'll be back and not only to say hello to Genevieve!

No actually that was probably my own ploy. No matter. Because with those two minor exceptions the service is super nice and helpful. Their food boards are to die for. (Trust me. I WILL die for food). They have a great selection of alcohols and alcohol. Happy hours specials and deals are fantastic. The location is brilliant. It's off of Trinity but I take the Lady Bird Trail. Yes a coffee shop happy hours food board food Mecca just off of the beaten path? vibe could only wish for that sort of convenience.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 41, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5679), List()), List(sentiment, 43, 159, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4553), List()), List(sentiment, 161, 201, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5656), List()), List(sentiment, 203, 252, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4675), List()), List(sentiment, 254, 301, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4896), List()), List(sentiment, 303, 358, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4723), List()), List(sentiment, 360, 498, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4823), List()), List(sentiment, 500, 545, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5291), List()), List(sentiment, 547, 588, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4531), List()), List(sentiment, 590, 599, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5040), List()), List(sentiment, 601, 678, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4730), List()), List(sentiment, 680, 712, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5002), List()), List(sentiment, 714, 745, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5367), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 798, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5225), List()), List(sentiment, 800, 844, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5212), List()), List(sentiment, 846, 871, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5576), List()), List(sentiment, 873, 923, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5534), List()), List(sentiment, 925, 1004, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4758), List()), List(sentiment, 1006, 1055, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5190), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>My God.

Their balsamic has a nutty base (cashew I think) and not too tangy. I was immensely impressed that despite how busy they were there was a server who greeted me not long after I entered the door and explained the process (how to order if to-go or dining in. This was especially important as I entered through the street entrance which is furthest from the counter/hostess station. I felt very comfortable to sit and peruse the menu and order in the time I needed. The service was also immensely friendly and helpful. Plus the food was delish and they included a checklist showing that my order was checked before sent out. It is more than most foodes but the quality of food certainly meets the expectation of the cost. If you parkinge more for high quantity/low cost skip.

I love the vibe at this cafe. It's also a plus that they serve food as well as coffee. I think I really enjoyed the vibe vintage-like vibe of this cafe. I ordered the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon food and Ohayo coffee and this was a good combination. I was looking for a food in between food and food and this was the perfect size. The food is very crispy and fresh out of the oven tasting and the salmon was cooked just right. I also think they sprinkle some roe on the top and it definitely adds some flavor to the dish. I think I enjoyed the vibe more than the food at this location. It is definitely vibeer than a Starbucks and more intimate. They also have these board games you can play and I stayed and played Monopoly for almost two hours. I think it's a really great place to just hang out or catch up with your friends.

There were two other vibe standing there just scooping ice cream into to go containers. Why couldn't one of them help out? If there are priceing vibe standing in front of you stop what you are doing and help them out. Then Matt goes over to the seating where my coworkers are sitting and complains to them about this poor guy. Dude if you have time to complain you have time to scoop food. Finally this poor guy asks me what I want and then Matt comes over and tells him to get more food from the back. Are you kidding me?? Matt are your arms broken? There were other vibe behind the counter that could have filled the food case!! Hey here is an idea you do it!!!! Then Matt also disappears to the back at which point we here him screaming at this poor guy from the back. Matt I think you are a horrible manager! If you can't get your service to do their service maybe you should take some management courses on how to treat vibe! While your at it take some anger management courses too!! We did not parking out of your place today due to slow service. We left because of you and how unprofessional you are.

My friend ordered a Chocolate Chip coffee & a Blueberry food which I really liked as well! The service were pretty friendly when I had questions about the food.

I mainly came here to try their food donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate. The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes but mine was filled with vanilla food on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the vibe but the taste of it was only decent. The food filling is kind of melted and frothy which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise I'd stick to their regular food selections. My mom and older brother both got food cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia which is the very liquid smooth and creamy dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their foodcake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach food. coffee is delish too. Just get everything. ;) Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here.

They got some nice girth. hoursed up my food food and I find as the advertised potatoes shoe string potatoes. Alright alright a different take. Shredded food on top but not even close to melted because it was laying on top of the shoe string potatoes. Like I said this must be a new take on food foods and I don't get it. Someone else may and this food is for you. I like the texture those potatoes provide but I wouldn't really advertise it as the potato for a potato food food and food food. I'll definitely come here for coffee again. The first time I went the service was really friendly. The second time I went they were in robot mode. Given...it was really packed.

All good choices but the food in a Basket and El Diablo are my favs. Their vanilla coffee was also really good! This place is super cute too. It's like actually underground. We had a party of 8 and we weren't too sure if they could even seating us. It looks so small and cute from the outside but when you go in there's some stairs that go down to two bigger seating areas. There's always a bunch of vibe there too so expect like a 25 minute wait for a seating. The food also takes a while to come out so don't come here if you need to leave in an hours.

This old frame house with interior painted walls depicting trees is filled with charm and service high quality coffee and food. The coffee that we ordered was smooth well foamed and without bitterness. There is plenty of seating at seatings and the internet speeds are a respectable 13 Mpbs download (I've managed to do work using VoIP at 1.5 Mbps). The food on the turkey food food was soft and moist and the food ingredients were piled high. Everything was fresh and the added food for $2 made it that much better. The salmon food was surprisingly large served in a chilled bowl was a giant portion of kale garnished with slices of beets halved grape tomatoes nuggets of goat food and dressed with sumac yogurt and a fennel vinaigrette and topped with freshly cooked salmon filets. Very fresh very filling and reasonably price. It was hard to choose what to order (grilled food burritos and chilaquiles were vying for my attention) and I'm eager to go back to try more of the menu.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 161, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4690), List()), List(sentiment, 163, 251, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4880), List()), List(sentiment, 253, 317, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5326), List()), List(sentiment, 319, 445, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5131), List()), List(sentiment, 447, 519, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5532), List()), List(sentiment, 521, 667, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4501), List()), List(sentiment, 669, 761, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5505), List()), List(sentiment, 763, 834, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4816), List()), List(sentiment, 836, 1101, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5285), List()), List(sentiment, 1103, 1147, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5227), List()), List(sentiment, 1149, 1301, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5377), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>9 check-ins I love the name...love the coffee...love the food (mostly the iced cinnamon rolls...thank goodness I don't work in the same shopping strip anymore...I think I'd eat one everyday)...love the alcohol selection...love the abbreviated menu from the grove in case you're hungry...love the service...

They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are which is nice when trying a new coffee house. I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar. They have a variety of different types of seating from couches to seatings for working with laptops to a bar\\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee. I ordered a half summer moon coffee as I don't like my coffee super sweet. I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste but it had a smooth taste. My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet. So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process. They seem to be doing a good service checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to coffee an ounce of coffee and adjusting accordingly but watching the service tamp it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure. Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied. This would explain the slight watered down coffee. If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor. It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of coffee which was very visible as I watched the coffee come out as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure. They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer service to measure the tamping pressure until they are vibed enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of coffee. Yes!

I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I have no idea why this place isn't as popular as Blue Bottle or Stumptown. Admittedly those coffee are good. I just think Summermoon has a special place in my heart. Wood. Fire. Roasted. How does that not spell \"\"AWESOME\"\" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town this is where I am going to take them. I always get a half Wintermoon coffee or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee vibe then you may want to order it as a plain coffee and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl. It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet rich creamy with parkingamel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some vibe even drink it black. If I did I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good coffee come from good coffee still...after all. But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully only being 5 miles away that means I'll be here way more often. Nice clean and functional layout. They've got a few seatings and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it. It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the seating are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 64, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6228), List()), List(sentiment, 66, 75, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 77, 86, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 88, 97, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 99, 173, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4583), List()), List(sentiment, 175, 207, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5073), List()), List(sentiment, 209, 264, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4905), List()), List(sentiment, 266, 270, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 272, 276, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4866), List()), List(sentiment, 278, 285, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 287, 350, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6958), List()), List(sentiment, 352, 415, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5578), List()), List(sentiment, 417, 475, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4745), List()), List(sentiment, 477, 512, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5529), List()), List(sentiment, 514, 641, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5493), List()), List(sentiment, 643, 691, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4663), List()), List(sentiment, 692, 692, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 693, 693, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 694, 750, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4845), List()), List(sentiment, 752, 875, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5247), List()), List(sentiment, 877, 906, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5373), List()), List(sentiment, 908, 972, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4353), List()), List(sentiment, 974, 1013, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5168), List()), List(sentiment, 1014, 1014, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1015, 1015, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1016, 1025, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5155), List()), List(sentiment, 1027, 1071, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5514), List()), List(sentiment, 1073, 1150, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5319), List()), List(sentiment, 1152, 1184, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5231), List()), List(sentiment, 1186, 1235, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4888), List()), List(sentiment, 1237, 1306, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6019), List()), List(sentiment, 1308, 1336, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3992), List()), List(sentiment, 1338, 1364, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5193), List()), List(sentiment, 1366, 1493, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5426), List()), List(sentiment, 1494, 1494, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1495, 1495, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1496, 1559, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5171), List()), List(sentiment, 1560, 1560, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Listed in Wi-Fi for Free Hippies love it!

The Internet here is pretty fast. You can actually get work done here. The vibe is not obnoxious.

Then I parking up and order a Rosemary salt bagel as well and a chai coffee with a shot of coffee. The service (shortish with dreadlocks) stares down at the seatingt and ignores me. He looks up and loudly yells in front of the whole restaurant \"\"yo! Salt bagel vibe get back here I need to ring you up!\"\" Since my seatingmate just paid and I'm just standing there I assume he's talking about vibe from a few minutes ago that were ahead of us in line. \"\"DUDE! Those vibe just parkinged off. GUYS I NEED TO RING YOU UP!\"\" My seatingmate comes back to the counter and is like \"\"What's going on?\"\" He then says \"\"Where's your little friend? I need to ring her up.\"\" She looks at me (again I am standing right in front of the counter trying to order). \"\"Ummm.. She's right there.\"\" The idiot service looks at me and says \"\"oh I thought you parkinged away.\"\" I AM STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES. \"\"you're invisible I guess.\"\" He says. Awesome. Then he asks me AGAIN. What I'd like to order even though I already said it twice. I get my chai and it is absolutely the worst I've ever had. Lukewarm and it tasted like basil? Completely lazy. We had asked for butter with our bagels we got burnt bagels with cream food. After a rough morning being told you're invisible and an entirely screwed up order I just lost it.

It was kinda that place where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go location but couldn't actually go location (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire or even a gas stove for that matter a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry Halcyon. Then when a friend visited me junior year we went to Halcyon because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores I do like me some coffee. Sadly the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au coffee's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying Halcyon. At least you're still cute. But apparently it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously OBSESSED. Thankfully she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight the awesome bartender and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total and naturally I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself Halcyon.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 56, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5297), List()), List(sentiment, 58, 214, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5302), List()), List(sentiment, 216, 319, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4504), List()), List(sentiment, 321, 467, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4815), List()), List(sentiment, 469, 482, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 484, 619, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5364), List()), List(sentiment, 621, 741, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4581), List()), List(sentiment, 743, 856, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4726), List()), List(sentiment, 858, 885, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5579), List()), List(sentiment, 887, 913, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5148), List()), List(sentiment, 915, 1022, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4927), List()), List(sentiment, 1024, 1082, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5603), List()), List(sentiment, 1084, 1102, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4861), List()), List(sentiment, 1104, 1276, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 1278, 1300, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4886), List()), List(sentiment, 1302, 1414, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6046), List()), List(sentiment, 1416, 1538, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5850), List()), List(sentiment, 1540, 1572, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()))</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Ok this place has unbelievable coffee drinks!

Wonderful coffee shop! FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla coffee and I really really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency and the coffee + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of food if you're hungry but honestly the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had. AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow wonderful wonderful and wonderful. The service were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter the two service were always working: wiping seatings sweeping the floors cleaning the coffee machine etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly and made the whole vibe more enjoyable. The vibe is very vibe. This is a pretty small coffee shop but full of soft light and is very vibe. Plenty of internet along the walls so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive. PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately quite a few of the parking seating are designated \"\"10 minutes\"\" or \"\"30 minutes\"\" but there should still be plenty of seating remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeehop that wasn't limited to street parking at all. COME AGAIN?: Yes absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done this is definitely the place I would go. However I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little vibe for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well.

I mean she has price many years in Austria travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar coffee machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from. When she talks about drinking coffee she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time. Before she became so good at knowing great coffee I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it. This was about 6-7 years ago. Last year after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global vibe of drinking coffee. She said \"\"Hmm that's a tough question. I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to. My mom also likes to drink coffee. She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly. She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee. \"\"TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!\"\" she bellowed out. So we loaded up in the parking and headed out. However I wasn't taking her to Starbucks. Since there is a Starbucks on every corner she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said \"\"Where in the Hell are you taking me!\"\". I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years. \"\"What are you doing? This is ridiculous! \"\" she continued on. By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location) her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system. She orders the Hunapu straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink. The last thing I remember her saying was \"\"I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn this is good\"\".

Coffee Shops with coffee vibe 24/7 coffee shop that offers great coffee seating and plenty of seating option along with yummy food bites!!! Why can't we have something like this in DFW already??? Maybe they're not ready for vibe like me who would definitely \"\"camp\"\" out over night at their coffee shop if there was one in Dallas :( After our late food I wanted something sweet surprise not. Checking out at least couple new coffee shops while in Austin was also on my to do list. Epoch was only about 10mins from where we were at and stays hours 24/7 made it the perfect pick. It took us a few minutes looking for a parking spot in their small lot. We gave up and decided to parking on the street ur best option. The coffee shop was packed at almost 11pm on a Thursday night not too big of a surprise since it's not far from UT swamped with night owls was completely understandable. We each got a hazelnut coffee. I was a lil disappointed to see somewhat of crappy coffee vibe on both but the delicious smooth coffee made up for it along with their delicious strawberry rhubarb pie making my first vibe with rhubarb pie a great one. We would have stayed here longer if the mosquitoes didn't like me too much and started munching on me.

There's ample seating for the size of the place and a community seating for meetings or just stealing a seating to get some work done.

There's also a parking lot in the back so there's no hassle with street parking! On to the drinks: the vanilla coffee is awesome and I also really like their coffee. I'm not much of a coffee aficionado but I think they both tasted great! The service are friendly and make the vibe vibe and inviting. A con if anything is that it gets kind of dark if you're here when the sun starts to go down.

I will admit that the drinks are bad price; it's always painful taking out my wallet here. But when you have coffee as good as theirs...how can you not get some?!

So when I was a fat kid I learned to do three things really well: 1. Make vibe laugh. 2. Field strip clean and reassemble a Colt Government M-1911 .45 ACP. 3. Sit & shoot a pencil out of my stomach with unerring accuracy up to seven feet. The point is I'm deadly serious now about food & sweets because I'm acutely aware of what I consume these days and how often I consume it. And also fat kids may be all smiley and laughing around you but what they really want to do is blow your brains out. This may be TMI. But it does segue nicely to Mary's Pop Shop. Unfortunately when I was there the actual \"\"gelato pop\"\" portion of the menu wasn't quite ready yet although it should be in place by the time you read this. But there were four types of food available with three kinds of giant food/cookie concoctions which all looked good but exceeded my calorie calculations. So I went with a tarragon food food food. And it was a really good tarragon food food food. Huge breast chunks grapes & pecans? Subtle mayo spicing & celery? Yeah that works for me. It also appears to be a one-man operation with him doing everything and his website story is touching. The shop itself is cool. The coffee smells great. I'm curious now about the morning \"\"Breakfast food\"\" specials and how slammed he'll be during peak hours. But what impressed me the most was when he took my money gave me change but then washed his hands put on gloves and made my tarragon food food food. You know stuff we take for granted? Don't. So right now I'm a fan of Mary's Pop Shop and I haven't even tasted the food yet. My instinct here is to let the newness diffuse a bit let the tweaks settle in and give this place a chance to catch its breath. And then pop in for a food update. I'm calculating the moments.

I started buying coffee from them several years ago and have been impressed by the consistency and quality of their product. It is a place where you want to go when you are buying fresh beans. Do not judge them by the coffeeed coffee they have in the store. It is often too strong and not well coffeeed. It doesn't do justice to the quality of their beans. Over the years I have pointed coffee loving friends to this store and everyone who has tried it loves their coffee. Once when we were out of coffee and didn't want to make the drive to Anderson's (about 15-20 minutes from my house) we picked up some of the higher quality coffee from HEB that was about the same price as what we bought at Anderson's. We brought it home and coffeeed it up. I couldn't believe how bad it was in comparison to what we were used to drinking. We poured it out threw it in the trash and made a trip. Stop by support a local Austin business and enjoy some great coffee. Note that they will also ship to vibe out of town. Here is a bonus: Try coffeeing your coffee in an Aeropress. You can pick one up at Anderson's or on-line at Amazon.

I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The service have all been really friendly. The vibe is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming. There aren't a ton of seating/outlets so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome but I have never seen internet out there so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends and it's nice outside then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study good luck finding a good seating. My favorite drink is the honey nut coffee--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of coffee it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours. I've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee) which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk. The only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can parking in the local location but even then it can get vibeed and be a pretty far parking. Sometimes I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times some vibe will pull in even though I've been sitting in my parking with my blinker on. parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird. Overall love Thunderbird.

Given that this is finals season for UT students I expected to have issues finding a seating or parking but I really didn't which was a nice surprise. Given I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact it was pretty empty which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends it seems to be super packed. There's a lot of natural light and the color scheme is easy on the eyes and the vibe is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha The vibe is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal seating and seatings the internet is free and fast (and has an adorable password!) internet are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some seating) the vibe is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of vibe who come--middle aged vibe getting some work done yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine college students studying etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole vibe is pretty chill but for some reason everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again maybe I just came at a good time. A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy. In terms of the beverages the first time I came I got a hot vanilla coffee and this time I got an iced vanilla coffee. I also tried my friend's iced coffee too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The coffee didn't have notes of a super dark rich coffee which I'm vibeally ok with. Slightly too sweet but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. price are on par with other places in Austin. The service are also very friendly patient and seem like normal humans. Overall this is one of my favorite coffee seating in Austin! I vibeally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom but the vibe of it is cute for what they had to work with haha. 10/10 would come again. and again. and again.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 33, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6764), List()), List(sentiment, 35, 184, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4781), List()), List(sentiment, 186, 223, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4743), List()), List(sentiment, 225, 372, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5496), List()), List(sentiment, 374, 488, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5556), List()), List(sentiment, 490, 588, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5898), List()), List(sentiment, 590, 642, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4993), List()), List(sentiment, 644, 711, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3604), List()), List(sentiment, 713, 1031, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5431), List()), List(sentiment, 1033, 1198, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5288), List()), List(sentiment, 1200, 1261, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5131), List()), List(sentiment, 1263, 1368, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5580), List()), List(sentiment, 1370, 1417, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4944), List()), List(sentiment, 1419, 1467, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5015), List()), List(sentiment, 1469, 1498, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3266), List()), List(sentiment, 1500, 1562, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5300), List()), List(sentiment, 1564, 1681, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5440), List()), List(sentiment, 1683, 1723, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5402), List()), List(sentiment, 1725, 1765, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5406), List()), List(sentiment, 1767, 1850, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5505), List()), List(sentiment, 1852, 1912, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5721), List()), List(sentiment, 1914, 1958, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4726), List()), List(sentiment, 1960, 2030, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5470), List()), List(sentiment, 2032, 2091, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3809), List()), List(sentiment, 2093, 2135, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5853), List()), List(sentiment, 2137, 2275, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4993), List()), List(sentiment, 2277, 2299, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4932), List()), List(sentiment, 2301, 2310, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5209), List()), List(sentiment, 2312, 2321, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5209), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>This shop is one of my favorites in Austin and there is a ton of competition in this city!

I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black iced no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision. For food please please please try the monkey food. It has honey walnuts maple syrup and God knows what else. For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy food options as well as gluten-free and vegan options. And finally for food the food pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need.

Before I would always get the milk tea boba but asked for them to do it hot (not a lot of boba places will do it hot but it reminds me of the motherland). Als its the middle of Texas summer so that would be crazy right now. So lately I have tried their lemonades and regular cold milk tea bobas. My favorite lemonade hands down is the blueberry mint. Its tart sweet and so freshing! It does take a few minutes to make so be patient when its done it comes out the window by the kitchen in the back. As noted in my previous review their milk tea is a perfect balance of tea and sweetness. They dont over sweetened their milk tea so it really brings the tea flavor out. I have had both the green tea and the black tea milk boba but since I am a boring vibe I am more partial to the original black milk tea. The service is always wonderful and lovely! My dog training is right nearby so on Wednesdays I bring my pup with me and she can hang out outside with the doggy water bowl while I run in to grab a drink. They are nice enough to bring it out to me everytime so that way I can chill outside with the dog. When I am craving something sweet the strawberry brick food hits the spot. It has large halved strawberries on top of a giant sweet food with condensed milk. Two vibe can share this massive thing easily. As for savory they have their basil food which is delicious! The spices they use on it is so addicting! Two things this places needs though umbrellas for shade outside and a punch parkingd!! Oooh!

Having idle time the other day stopped in and ordered a Cafe coffee and one of the Apple Turnovers. I was very disappointed in the coffee. It taste burned and far too acidic. The presentation was fantastic but the quality was on the low end. Its been a tough road comparing coffee in the states as much of it seems to be a \"\"fad\"\" as opposed to good coffee. Although my visit to Red Horn Coffee House was a great vibe. I guess if I'm ordering a flavored coffee from Monkey Nest it might mask the low quality coffee enough to enjoy. The apple turnover however was really good. Plus one star.... The location was quite busy and packed with students and young adults.

Drinks: I'm really picky with my coffee - but this place is always a hit or miss. I've tried a variety of their flavored coffee and I think the iced parkingamel one is my favorite BUT it really depends on who the service of the day is... BTW they now have ice-cream food?? It's worth a try but I think I'm going to stick with the original ones. Misc: There's a good number of metered parking seating on the side and tons of internet for your electronic devices and the seating isn't that bad although it does get quite busy when school is in session. Anyway if you're reading this I bet you have never been to a cream food food so do yourself a favor and go now!

It has this subtle scent of lavender and fooded marshmallow. The vibe is so cute and vibe yet very vibesy and trendy! Their service is really great and the location is great if you are in central Austin. If I had the money and lived closer I would come here every day! The building is covered in vibe on the outside too. There is not much parking available but many vibe parking or ride their bicycles here so I have never had trouble actually finding parking. I bring my sister here every time she is in town from Dallas along with all of my close friends who are coffee lovers.

I'm not sure if meeting someone for coffee should really be that stressful... The service are hit-or-miss in terms of pleasantness.

There were some seating available outside but it was too windy and a tad bit chilly so we decided to just wait a bit longer to get a seating inside. I was surprised that they didn't seating us earlier because when we parkinged in there were at least 5 empty seatings but the wait wasn't horrendous so it's okay. I decided to order the coffee and the parkingibbean French food and a side of foods. I didn't expect the coffee to be so bitter. I had to add 3 packets of sugar before I liked it. The parkingibbean French food was delicious!! It was a huge portion so definitely it. The gave large thick slices of food which definitely made the French food better. There were pecans and bananas on top but the sauce was definitely the best part: dark parkingamel rum.I totally recommend getting the French food!!

Pretty much only two ways to screw up the coffee for me is to use too dark of a roast on the beans or serve the milk too hot. They didn't commit either of those sins. To eat I ordered the kale bowl. This was some of the best kale I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the dressing or they gave it an extra long massage.

No much bitterness at all. Disclaimer: I ordered an coffee with a small amount of hot water. -coffee choices: limited. No fancy Starbucks menu or syrups. Just coffee coffee coffee. Can get them on ice. But this isn't really a negative thing. They focus on coffee and do it well. -seating: VERY limited. 5 metal bar stools at a single counter. This is the one reason it's not a 5star for me. After talking to one of the services I understand they don't intend to be a large \"\"stay while\"\" kind of shop. More geared towards grab-n-go or according to the service the opportunity for one-on-one convos with the few vibe who do stick around. One single two-outlet plug. -wifi: nope.

It's the only coffee shop remotely close to my location it's 24 hrs free WiFi a \"\"quiet\"\" study area they showcase local vibeists and they've expanded their business to do cool things like supporting live vibe and hoursing a restaurant. These are all very cool things..but there are some things about the place that are \"\"meh\"\" and a couple of things that seriously f'n suck. The coffee and food are okay. A couple of things are really good--the peanut-butter frap drink and the \"\"strange coffee\"\" drink come to mind--but everything else I've had is basically standard service fair: decent and about what you'd expect (a.k.a. much better than 7/11 coffee but not appreciably different from any other coffee house.) And there is almost always a line for service which isn't a big deal but it can get really long and when it does they don't handle the volume especially efficiently. Most of the service are friendly though and acknowledge the long wait. The first thing that drives me nuts about the place is the smell--I'm not exaggerating when I say it smells funky ALL of the time. There is a faint moldy mildewy funk about the seating area seatings and especially the vibe study seating. I've been several times--in different months and in different weather conditions---it's just an old building that has deep-seated mold issues. After awhile you stop noticing it so much but whenever I first arrive it hits me like a wall and I have visions of toxic black fungi particles wafting thru the air. The second thing that drives me nuts is the live vibe that's pumped into the main seating area. 9 out of 10 vibe in those seatings are there to study---not check out a live band. It's distracting in a couple of ways. First live vibe isn't the same kind of back-ground hum as an album or Pandora station (what they usually have pumping through the speakers.) There is a conversational staccato and noise level variance to live shows that make it an anathema to background sound. What's worse though is that the live shows sound levels are actually attenuated in such a way that they come through the the seating speakers a few decibels louder than the Pandora stations. I repeat---almost everyone there is there to vibely study NOT to listen to a live show. I've complained about it and I was told that there \"\"was nothing they could do about it.\"\" If it was a Friday or Saturday night I wouldn't even have complained. But this will happen during the middle of the day on a Sunday--it doesn't matter. If there is a band playing everyone in the building has to listen to it. Why Strange coffee wants to force everybody in the building to listen to the live vibe too is beyond me. If it's a marketing idea it's a bad one. It's worth nothing that the \"\"quiet\"\" seating doesn't have speakers. The noise from the speakers in the next seating do bleed in there as well and as aforementioned it's the smelliest seating in the joint. It's also rather poorly lit. The main seating area is much more comfortable. I honestly think that a good deal of the popularity of the Strange coffee is a direct result of the fact that those of us who live in south of Ben White Blvd. have precious few options in the ways of coffee houses (and bars and vibe venues for that matter.) Strange coffee is helping fill a much needed void---and I'm grateful for that. They are clearly promoting vibe and culture in South Austin and I truly find that both admirable and great for the community. But I dearly wish some other businesses would come help fill the void to give us additional options. Are there any entrepreneurs out there reading this? Please come hours a truly student friendly coffee house in South Austin!!! I for one will never return to Strange coffee again...unless there's a band a wanna check out. That said I am still eagerly anticipating the hoursing of their new restaurant. My fingers are crossed for the services that all is going well and on track. I hope the food is good---if it is I will become one the first regulars.\"</td><td>2.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 29, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5833), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 30, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 31, 31, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 32, 76, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4782), List()), List(sentiment, 78, 313, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4678), List()), List(sentiment, 315, 345, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5211), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 346, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 347, 452, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5052), List()), List(sentiment, 454, 482, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5202), List()), List(sentiment, 484, 790, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4947), List()), List(sentiment, 791, 957, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4681), List()), List(sentiment, 959, 1028, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5166), List()), List(sentiment, 1030, 1159, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4927), List()), List(sentiment, 1161, 1266, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4750), List()), List(sentiment, 1268, 1409, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5253), List()), List(sentiment, 1411, 1574, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4586), List()), List(sentiment, 1576, 1670, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4543), List()), List(sentiment, 1672, 1753, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5278), List()), List(sentiment, 1755, 1791, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5105), List()), List(sentiment, 1793, 2052, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5395), List()), List(sentiment, 2054, 2243, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4574), List()), List(sentiment, 2245, 2331, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.464), List()), List(sentiment, 2333, 2492, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4679), List()), List(sentiment, 2494, 2574, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5360), List()), List(sentiment, 2576, 2647, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4677), List()), List(sentiment, 2649, 2752, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4434), List()), List(sentiment, 2754, 2793, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4894), List()), List(sentiment, 2795, 2862, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5525), List()), List(sentiment, 2864, 2999, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5321), List()), List(sentiment, 3001, 3028, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4900), List()), List(sentiment, 3030, 3076, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5475), List()), List(sentiment, 3078, 3235, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5682), List()), List(sentiment, 3237, 3413, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5398), List()), List(sentiment, 3415, 3539, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5560), List()), List(sentiment, 3541, 3640, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4440), List()), List(sentiment, 3642, 3692, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.7352), List()), List(sentiment, 3694, 3767, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5302), List()), List(sentiment, 3769, 3820, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5410), List()), List(sentiment, 3821, 3821, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 3822, 3822, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 3823, 3862, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4828), List()), List(sentiment, 3864, 3942, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5585), List()), List(sentiment, 3944, 4019, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5521), List()), List(sentiment, 4021, 4092, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5661), List()), List(sentiment, 4093, 4093, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>2 check-ins I just love this place so much.

The volume level is medium to high I would say but of course depends on the time and vibe. There are two seatings that can be reserved for groups at 15 bucks an hours in the form of purchases . When not reserved vibe are welcomed to use the area. Because of the seatings there aren't many seatings to choose from during busy hours. I like the service too.

I love that they first give you the clear option of lounge seating or full-service without any sort of confusion. The vibe is also quite nice - modern but warm and charming. Lots of natural vibe. We chose the full service and ordered the Century Oaks Tea Service which is sort of a full-English tea service - comes with a pot of tea a scone tea foods a slice of tea food and two tea food. In terms of tea selection there is a *TON* of high-quality choices. We got a reserve black tea which turned out to be quite nice (smooth and balanced with a more adventurous grassy finish). The food accompaniments were also all top-notch. The tea foods were tiny little sweet treats that were perfectly-sized considering their sweetness. The scone was a cheddar-rosemary scone and it came with clotted cream and raspberry jam; this was truly the star of the tea service. I loved the scone's savory flavor with the not-to-sweet jam and the richness of the clotted cream; excellent combination. The tea food was an orange tea food with this candied orange icing; while the food itself was moist and flavorful we did feel that the icing was far too sweet. Finally we got the lemon scallion and romesco food; both went perfectly well with the entire tea service. All in all a delightful vibe. They seem to have a great selection of food and coffee.

But this is a \"\"hipster\"\" cafe after all so for this standard - it's worth getting! - sea salt creme coffee: a ton of ice goes into this drink.

Total was less than $10 which was pretty decent. A typical coffee and food at a coffee shop will also be at least $7. Decent internet! Which I always appreciate.

The service is very friendly and easy going which already puts them well ahead of other coffee shops in Austin. My boyfriend was able to have a video conference call so I know the internet works well also. This is a really hip spot with an eclectic fan base which makes for a fun vibe to meet up with friends not so much for studying or reading (unless with headphones).

I couldn't help but make gleeful little moans as I took each bite- so much that my boyfriend rolled his eyes and asked if I needed some alone time ha!

At this place I especially dislike having this disposition because they probably have the friendliest service of any coffee shop in Austin. They ask you how you're doing they joke with you they draw cool pictures in your dirty chai. They just seem genuinely happy and it's a great way to start your day even if you're not quite there yet. Finally they also serve food foods. I realize this is basically mandatory of any coffee shop in Austin but it's something that needs to be pointed out.

I hear the other food are equally as impressive. The only negative to shopping here is its easy to spend lots of cash now I will say you do get what you price for which is great quality! There's more here than alcohol and food also.. if I can stop being distracted by the alcohol I might try some other stuff someday.

Usually when someone suggests getting food I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out food over ice cream. It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy. Some of my vibeal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat food and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo nuts whiskey pecan coconut Nutella (can you think food mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing! You won't be disappointed. They have a nice little seating with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business. It's truly a location place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital. I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that service apple cider here local (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country it still brings back good memories. (Personally I'd avoid the whipped cream and parkingmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a food drink; to me a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a food food or two as well. And there are always a few food available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day. But TEO is still a real gem overall.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 56, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6316), List()), List(sentiment, 58, 204, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4684), List()), List(sentiment, 206, 219, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5210), List()), List(sentiment, 221, 323, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5529), List()), List(sentiment, 325, 376, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4998), List()), List(sentiment, 378, 396, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4878), List()), List(sentiment, 398, 532, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5615), List()), List(sentiment, 534, 656, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5459), List()), List(sentiment, 658, 683, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4901), List()), List(sentiment, 685, 779, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5366), List()), List(sentiment, 781, 868, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4520), List()), List(sentiment, 870, 886, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4876), List()), List(sentiment, 888, 948, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5168), List()), List(sentiment, 950, 1027, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4734), List()), List(sentiment, 1029, 1117, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5178), List()), List(sentiment, 1119, 1214, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5364), List()), List(sentiment, 1216, 1352, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4911), List()), List(sentiment, 1354, 1472, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4530), List()), List(sentiment, 1474, 1518, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4993), List()), List(sentiment, 1519, 1618, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4937), List()), List(sentiment, 1620, 1642, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5029), List()), List(sentiment, 1644, 1678, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5384), List()), List(sentiment, 1680, 1744, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5362), List()), List(sentiment, 1746, 1827, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4663), List()), List(sentiment, 1829, 1933, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5113), List()), List(sentiment, 1935, 1970, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5278), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>This place has been mine and my husband's saviour since we had a baby.

The food were okay but definitely not what I was expecting. The lemon bar was good. The food were a pretty huge thumbs down for me.

Every single vibe there treats you like you're their best friend. - The food is not trying to be fancy or modern. It's your typical food joint / diner but so delicious. I'd rather go here than some of the other food diners :P (Some other reviewers have mentioned these other places). I always try to get something different when I come here but I always gravitate towards the omelets. They are HUGE! And comes with a (generous) side of hash browns usually. - They have daily specials which are actually pretty different from the menu items. I've gotten a daily special once or twice because it just sounded REALLY good. And it was! The daily specials are a bit more adventurous. Highly recommend going here if you have a chance but expect to wait a while if you're going on Saturday or Sunday morning. Usually about 30-45 minutes on average. One time I came here around 8AM on a weekday for a to-go coffee and it was already pretty poppin.

I move to the only other place to sit which is a chair that has an electrical internet behind it. Fantastic. I plug in and go to the counter to order my coffee and sit back down. I couldn't locate internet so I go wait in line to ask about it. I'm told there's no internet on weekends but normally there's no password and I'd be able to easily connect.

The main reason I go to coffee shops is just to get out of the apt or to read a book in good weather so one of the main criteria I judge coffee shops by is their outdoor seating. Furthermore the difference between a good and great coffee shop is the comfort of their furniture. More shops should realize that splurging on decent furniture is a very wise investment (lookin' at you Caffe Medici). I was pleasantly surprised by Mama's seating seating. Chic AND comfortable. A+ I went to try their coffee but was swayed by the tea. They have a small but eclectic collection of drinks - mate Mexican coffee lots of coffee hot & cold and some interesting-looking alcohols I've never heard of. As others have pointed out this area of E 6th is quickly turning into an alley of high-priced condos. I'm calling it the Yuppie Corridor - between about Chicon & Pedernales. The area is odd because it seems so isolated and desolate. There's really not many vibe around - at least not when I've been down here. I assume most of these condos are still waiting to be filled. I'd seen Hot Mama's before riding my bike down this way but the strip mall vibe was a put off. From the street it looks like just another average coffee shop. But I decided to try the place solely based on other reviews.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 95, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5441), List()), List(sentiment, 97, 274, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5459), List()), List(sentiment, 276, 373, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5393), List()), List(sentiment, 375, 491, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6098), List()), List(sentiment, 493, 545, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5590), List()), List(sentiment, 547, 567, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5229), List()), List(sentiment, 569, 624, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4408), List()), List(sentiment, 626, 783, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4780), List()), List(sentiment, 785, 885, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5339), List()), List(sentiment, 887, 957, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5182), List()), List(sentiment, 959, 1016, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4671), List()), List(sentiment, 1018, 1093, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4859), List()), List(sentiment, 1095, 1155, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4774), List()), List(sentiment, 1157, 1250, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4649), List()), List(sentiment, 1252, 1314, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4763), List()), List(sentiment, 1316, 1376, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5585), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>To those new to Austin that are searching for their go-to: Give it a try one day but keep looking. The service is unwelcoming and pretty passive aggressive. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because of a friend's recommendation. We took some time to look over the menu options for a bit but the service seemed annoyed and almost impatient with us. We weren't even in line or anywhere near the cash register which I found odd but whatever. What really did rub me the wrong way was when we did get around to placing our orders the service was as rude as Donald Trump at a campaign rally. For example I kindly asked her about their tea coffee and something in her expression visibly turned sour. I'll never forget how she narrowed her eyes and pointed at their tea selections behind her not even bothering to name some of them just mumbling that this was what they had. Once the orders were placed there was no eye contact and no \"\"thank you have a nice day.\"\" She immediately moved on to the next customer. Very poor manners. We ordered some of their food with a coffee and tea coffee. It was overall good but I found out that their food aren't even made in-house (they are pre-prepared from somewhere else I believe) which was disappointing. We heard they had fresh food goods but we didn't get to try any. The hot drinks are all right but they get cold pretty quickly. The seating situation is a nightmare but we got lucky and found somewhere to sit outside. I can't speak for indoor seating but from what I saw they don't do a good service at wiping off some of the empty seatings inside. Outdoor seatings are small and wobbly - seating included. The vibe was chill for the most part. I'm not sure if I would come back for the rude service or drinks. Maybe I could overlook those two things if I wanted to try their food goods or food again but when a service member treats vibe like they don't belong then it's hard to get that bad taste out of your mouth. I suggest that if you don't practice common courtesy or keep a professional face on at all times then you don't belong in the service industry.\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 97, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 99, 155, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 157, 242, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5186), List()), List(sentiment, 244, 361, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4910), List()), List(sentiment, 363, 452, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5651), List()), List(sentiment, 454, 599, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4593), List()), List(sentiment, 601, 706, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5282), List()), List(sentiment, 708, 880, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5182), List()), List(sentiment, 882, 1018, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4526), List()), List(sentiment, 1020, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4862), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1097, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5311), List()), List(sentiment, 1099, 1254, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4901), List()), List(sentiment, 1256, 1319, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4945), List()), List(sentiment, 1321, 1382, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5321), List()), List(sentiment, 1384, 1472, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5392), List()), List(sentiment, 1474, 1603, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5210), List()), List(sentiment, 1605, 1661, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4788), List()), List(sentiment, 1663, 1699, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4384), List()), List(sentiment, 1701, 1765, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5761), List()), List(sentiment, 1767, 1972, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5602), List()), List(sentiment, 1974, 2116, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 2117, 2117, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Dulce de leche food was excellent.

Not great but good. I went here mainly in search of an excellent blueberry food having heard that they make some of the best right there. It was satisfying but not at all what I'd hoped for. The food top was like a giant square block and didn't have the crispy golden exterior I'm used to seeing on my favorite foods elsewhere. It just looked unusual. Also not a fan of the crystallized sugar on top which as I recall this place does. The blueberries were still juicy and pleasant though and the inside was crumbly and sweet so I was content for the moment. Also had a tuna food that was unremarkable. Just a mediocre tuna food really. When I went back craving another blueberry food it was very dry and didn't taste as good. With several other excellent bakeries to choose from I'm not sure how likely it is I'll go back to Russell's.

It gets pretty packed on weekends with young adults/college students.This is the place for vibe watching in Austin. Cons: internet is not reliable at all.

I came in several times right after they hoursed and each time was just lacking. The drinks took a really long time to make and the service was so... bland. They hit a low point when I went in with a friend one evening and we both ordered the chai tea - mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk. The girl at the counter called out that our drinks were ready and I went to grab them. Both were in mugs and I asked which was which. In response I got \"\"Um I think that's the almond.\"\" So away we went. My friend and I were deep in conversation enjoying our chai coffee when the service comes over and says \"\"I think you're drinking the wrong ones.\"\" She picked up each of our mugs sniffed them and says \"\"Yep you're drinking each other's...\"\" and proceeds to switch our mugs! Keep in mind we were halfway finished with our drinks at this point. It was a huge turnoff and just made for a really awkward moment--and they should thank their lucky stars that I'm not lactose intolerant or vegan... or a really mean Yelper. I was going to write this review a few weeks ago but seeing as they are fairly new and growing pains are normal and expected I decided to give them another shot... and I can say that they are really improving. Some good stuff: Coffee ice cubes. Great idea and I wish more coffee shops would do this. The coffee and tea menus are huge and include stuff you don't see in every coffee shop: cafe cubano cortadito traditional indian chai etc. Homemade syrups are also a plus as well as their selection of vegan ice cream dairy ice cream and food goods.

There are some great vibe pieces (my favs being the Trump/Clinton as clowns and the rhino) that made my food a little more enjoyable because they brought a smile to my face. The service here were absolutely awesome! The host/cashier especially. I had called ahead to find out the wait time and he was very kind to tell me there was none at the moment but that could change quickly. We were sat quickly and our orders were taken promptly. They have a bottomless cup of decent coffee and their Austin benedict (their most popular dish we were told) was on point. The accompanying bfast taters were hit and miss for texture but were flavorful. A friend got the Toad in the Hole that was surprisingly delish! The pesto in it was also on point! We left very full and satisfied and w/tax and tip for just under $20 it was a decent food find in the UT/Dwntwn area. Also we lucked out and got a street parking spot right in front but there were several other hours street parking seating along 17th as well. Toad in the hole The Austin benedict My fav piece of all!

I have been guilty of this myself until I discovered The Buzz Mill! Don't be intimidated by the bear logo sign at the front; it's actually quite a welcoming place. If you can get past the lumberjack feel then you will appreciate: 1) It's a 24 hours coffee shop WITH BBQ! Whaaaaa? That's right who needs food goods and stale bagels for a late night food when you can get some meaty fatty BBQ. For clarification The Buzz Mill is a stand alone coffee shop they just have a food truck called The Blue Ox that service BBQ. They operate in conjunction but The Blue Ox stops service at 2 am or until they sell out. I'll write a separate review just for the BBQ. 2) The vibe is a little bit of everything. When you first parking in there are big seatings for group study. Then parking past the ordering bar and you'll see a strip full of cubbies for 1 2 or 3. This part was my favorite ^_^ There's also an outdoor campfire area where the occasional band will put on a show. Andddd THERE'S A HUGE JENGA SET! Life is complete when you have a huge jenga set. Oh this is also where the BBQ food truck is. Some things you might not appreciate: 1) The seatings in the cubbies are kind of small especially the ones for 2 vibe. It's definitely going to be a squeeze for your stuff so you might want to reconsider bringing your 50 pound Intermediate Accounting book. 2) If you're a coffee fanatic bad news. There's a very limited coffee selection. Not really a problem for me but I know it bothered the friends I came with. I came here twice in a span of 4 days and I'm positive I'll be back again.

I never would have thought it was here but for randomly seeing it when my husband and I spontaneously decided to drive around the surrounding location about a month ago. We wanted to check it out but it was hours at the time. I had an early morning meeting today and decided to stop by after. The service is super friendly and helpful. I had the iced Luna and it was perfection. Also had some food foods which are from Tex Mex off of Manor. I absolutely loved the black bean food and cactus food. Will need to check them out with the hubby sometime. I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now but with this place just a few blocks away from there I think I found a new morning spot.

Having lived in and around Dallas/Fort Worth for the past five years I had just started taking it as a given that a bank tower's ground floor coffee shop is a Starbucks. It's so refreshing to finally see an amazing local coffee shop in a great location. Having only been to this location once and on a Friday I don't know if my vibe was typical. Given my vibe with their location on Lamar I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of fooddeli food food get here early. When I was here just after 8 they had already sold out of most of them. I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas. Houndstooth knocked it out of the parking.

Java Jivin' I'm a coffee vibe over tea but I genuinely enjoyed Tea Haus! It's very modern and clean while still maintaining a comfortable vibe making it ideal for either working or meeting up with friends. I came because I was so generously invited to Angie L's UYE. My first instinct was to go with coffee but I ordered their signature milk tea with honey boba to branch out and try something new. I will be honest and say the drink itself I didn't parkinge for but if you are a tea vibe then you will LOVE it. The honey boba balls in the bottom of the drink were killer!! I wanted to order a separate bowl of just those to food on. I'm sure they make a delicious cup of coffee so next time I'm sticking with that. Plenty of variety on those drinks as well such as coffee made with both Ghirardelli chocolate and parkingamel coffee with a sea salt creme and one of my favorite drinks in the world the Affogato which is normally vanilla ice cream and coffee but here they add parkingamel and chocolate to it too because why not? Obviously they have a nice tea selection but believe it or not they even have creative lemonades like coconut chia with mint. We got to try their basil food and brick food as well. I've always been weird about food and hadn't eaten it in a while so when I got a piece that was fatty that was it for me. Everyone else really enjoyed it though because the spices they use are amazing. Make sure to squeeze the lime on top first to even out the flavors. The brick food however was right up my alley. It's a slice of thick food where the top has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk. Before service they add sliced strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. YUMMMM! Give me that and a coffee and I'm one happy girl. Definitely looking forward to a return visit.

After I ordered my vanilla custard food top cream food the girl at the counter sat on her phone texting for about 5 minutes.

Then someone else ordered a coffee and she got started on that right away. While I was still waiting for the cream food. The service came out to talk to her but she sat back down and was on her phone again. Finally after about 10 more minutes she noticed my receipt was still on the seating and she came out and blamed it on the service/manager saying that they were out of the vanilla custard (it was obvious that she did not make an attempt to alleviate this situation with me or the manager many minutes ago) and asked if I would like something else. Keep in mind that the vanilla custard is the most bad price cream food and the food top is also an additional charge. She made my second cream food in a matter of seconds. However it was not a food top and it was burnt and very crunchy. I am so disappointed in this service and in the cream food I have received. I paid almost 30% more for a cream food that was poorly made AND I had given her a nice big tip before this situation occurred.

Additionally I think its nice to have a little space every once in a while. Aside from the sleek design I think the offerings in themselves are nothing noteworthy. Simplicity is what lies behind the whole concept here in my opinion. If you are passing through this area of town (is West Lake Hills technically its own town?)

Couple days later I came in for another cup and didn't have a dollar (yeah for once a cup of coffee at an appropriate price) so they let me have the coffee and I promised to price next time. I love that kind of location customer service and trust. I'd give 6 stars if I could.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 114, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4352), List()), List(sentiment, 116, 214, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5880), List()), List(sentiment, 216, 334, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4624), List()), List(sentiment, 336, 441, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4871), List()), List(sentiment, 443, 483, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5860), List()), List(sentiment, 485, 674, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4790), List()), List(sentiment, 676, 731, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5933), List()), List(sentiment, 733, 760, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4718), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>How am I just finding out about Anderson's??

Also cream food are a pretty neat food alternative to froyo or ice cream or doughnuts. The price themselves aren't bad but the price for the amount of satisfaction I got were a little coffee. The mango was the best of the flavors I tried the matcha azuki was okay but kind of mild to actually taste anything besides cream and the vanilla bean custard was a disappointment. I mean the custard itself was amazing but I only got a tiny dribble inside the food itself so I mostly just ended up eating a plain shell.

I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen. The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office and they made it happen. I couldn't be happier. First I appreciate the design/layout. They leased a long narrow weird-shaped old space and made it BEAUTIFUL. This is not an easy feat. I know I tried to do the same with our office location. You can tell that the design was very well thought out. Lots of warm woods excellent vibe vibe on the walls and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite. I really love the ordering area. The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee. They have pour-overs several selections of beans and grinds and (the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance) the incredible Strada coffee machine. If you are a coffee connoisseur you won't be disappointed. As for the food I am thrilled. I like to eat healthy. Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts Phonatic Hopdoddy Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives. Last time I ate at Epoch I had an incredible Vegan Club food. It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good. Most importantly the vibe there are awesome. Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team. They like great vibe they know coffee and they are extremely friendly. I am big fan and I will be in Epoch often.

Location/ vibe: It's a really really small shop. Pretty limited seating and the seatings are tiny and seating are really awkward to sit in. I came in with two other friends and we sort of sat down (two on the long seating and me on a smaller chair)- all sort of seatinged to a tiny seating. My first thought when I parkinged in was \"\"Is this it??\"\" Bc the place is just kind of a long so all the seatings and seating are all next to each other with not much space. I was glad when we came in it wasn't busy and not very packed because it'd be awkward to have strangers sit so close to you. Overall small seatings with not much seating for much. Wouldn't come here for studying or a big group. food: I came around 7 or 8pm and I don't know if they ran out throughout the day but I didn't see much food selection. It was a small display case and no more. So we moved onto the ice cream- which they had a big selection of (Both Vegan and Dairy). They let you try out the flavors with a metal spoon so don't be scared to ask! We each got a flavor (Coconut Lemon foods and the strawberry) and it was pretty good but nothing to really say \"\"YEAH THAT WAS SPECIAL I'm definitely coming back again!!\"\" I wish I had tried their coffee (now seeing really great things about their coffee ice cubes). Service: It was alright. We got served and got stamp parkingds but I don't think I'll ever come here 10 more times to fill up that parkingd. It'd have been nice if she made some recommendations to what's pretty popular in the store when she saw us squinting at the menu and looking around the shop all indecisive. Overall an average place- but disclaimer: I'm not a vegan!! So I guess the vibe who are.. really appreciate this place!

They commonly host vibeians to play while you're enjoying coffee and taking in the location views. Their coffee is great although it doesn't stand out as much when compared to other coffee shops in Austin ( Summermoon anyone? ) but I truly enjoy the vibe they provide. There is additional seating upstairs and for the most part it's never too vibeed when you go there which is also another reason why I like this spot.

The vibe is a great place for a date as it has a very vibe and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The food were good- however nothing too special just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are priceing for the vibe. My cravings were on the other hand satisfied. This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks coffee and food.

The next batch wasn't much of an improvement despite being made by one of their *trained service*. Both turned out milky and weak.

I would even go as far as to say she was downright rude. If you've never been there before it's extremely confusing and even if you're standing right in front of her she wont acknowledge you until you just tell her what you want. As you can imagine if you dont even KNOW what you want this can be frustrating. She didn't even look up at us when we quite obviously parkinged up to the counter right in front of her. The weird part about it is there wasnt a menu even posted so when I parkinged up to her I actually needed help. She didnt say one word and I just looked around until I found something that looked like a menu. That is definitely not how I want to start any day. Obviously I havent HAD coffee yet (since I'm there to receive my java fix) please dont piss me off this early... The coffee was good which gives this place one star and the vibe was nice which gives me the other 2 stars. They need to work on I dunno smiling for starters and maybe basic communication can be next on the list. Customer service would give this place a firm 4 star rating and having a menu to make this whole proc ess quick and smooth would land this place a 5 star easily but...they definitely did not do that this time. I may give this place one more shot or just stick to Jo's off of SoCo since they're awesome all the time and know how to say \"\"hi\"\" when vibe parking up.\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 78, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5115), List()), List(sentiment, 80, 135, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4276), List()), List(sentiment, 137, 308, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5508), List()), List(sentiment, 310, 388, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5142), List()), List(sentiment, 390, 493, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4608), List()), List(sentiment, 495, 605, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4550), List()), List(sentiment, 607, 702, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4755), List()), List(sentiment, 704, 754, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4869), List()), List(sentiment, 756, 867, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4558), List()), List(sentiment, 869, 975, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4692), List()), List(sentiment, 977, 1080, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5496), List()), List(sentiment, 1082, 1246, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4896), List()), List(sentiment, 1247, 1247, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1248, 1248, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1249, 1290, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5156), List()), List(sentiment, 1292, 1445, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5813), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in One thing I've noticed about the Austin food scene is that the focus seems to be on the quaint little shop or food truck rather that the 150-seat venue that seems like it's a scene from that romantic comedy you saw a few years ago. While I do like romantic comedies lots of times I'd prefer the indie flick that hardly anyone's heard of but is so entertaining. Well Dolce Neve is a mix of both. It's not that big food shop with huge containers of food but it's also not that small shop that's a speak-easy establishment. They have almost 400 reviews and rated at 4.5 stars. That's extremely tough to do on Yelp without vibe knowing about it. We came on a hot Sunday afternoon. parking is location at the back and on the street. As I said the shop is small with about 4-5 seatings (depending on if you put them together). I was warmly greeted by both vibe working there at the time. I told them it was my first time and they happily explained their offerings. They have a good selection of food that is hand-scooped into a cup or cone. However my eyes immediately focused on their food food. My wife went with the salted parkingamel ice cream bar and I followed suit with a Stracciatella........... after my 3 flavors of food. Yes while my wife went with the incredibly delicious salted parkingamel food bar I went the traditional route and tried a cup of pistachio chocolate and salted parkingamel (recommended by the lady who helped me). While all 3 were spectacular the Stracciatella food food was calling my name. So I \"\"man'd up\"\" and got that too. =) Everything was so unbelievably fresh and comforting. I wish we had time in Austin to go back. Tip: The shop is right around the corner from the \"\"Greetings From Austin\"\" sign.

The vibe to me works. It's inviting and feels comfy. I think Epoch has set a standard for stand alone coffee shops and while this is similar in it's approach it's still unique enough to where it stands out to me. The vibe is always subtle but keeps up with the feel of the place and never overwhelmingly loud to where it's distracting. I don't know how often the vibe is changed out but it's all local vibeists and is usually pretty badass! I don't know if they cater to a theme but it's always pretty cool. The service are some of my favorite and combine the right amount of snark and sass. This obviously is vibeal preference but it feels right to me. I like some sass with my tea. Hah. It's probably cause I'm from Austin but I appreciate the myriad of non-chain coffee seating. I feel like again Epoch set the standard but all the one's I've been to seem to have their own self identifying features.

Now for the bad: * While accommodating they don't seem to parkinge to do so with a smile regardless of how I show up (with wife and kid with a friend for a alcohol with a laptop to work). This is somewhat of a systemic problem in Austin and they are only enabling the issue. * This place is only a good place to work when they want you to work - which is not after 5pm. internet shuts down at that time.

I will continue going here mostly because it's a great place for my family and since that seems to be how they want me to show up - to hang out/chill and not to work. My suggestion is to take a note out of Strange coffee's book and make area's of your place that are accommodating to everyone.</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 71, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5081), List()), List(sentiment, 73, 89, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5319), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 227, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5718), List()), List(sentiment, 229, 283, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5066), List()), List(sentiment, 285, 471, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4994), List()), List(sentiment, 473, 558, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4777), List()), List(sentiment, 560, 653, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5175), List()), List(sentiment, 655, 687, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5341), List()), List(sentiment, 689, 972, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5633), List()), List(sentiment, 974, 1139, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5192), List()), List(sentiment, 1141, 1266, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5161), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>We go here nearly every morning.

The space is fun and vibrant with color and there are seatings packed together inside. There is nothing fancy here just a converted house. There are a couple of seating to sit outside at the front and back door. On a cooler day eating outside is lovely as you can then escape the noisy banter inside. On a Sunday there is a line to the door and patience must be found as you wait 30-40 minutes after your order is placed. You place your order at the cash register and then receive a number to take with you to a seating to wait. The food is then delivered to you. seatings are first come - first serve so snag one if you are a party of two. They now serve food at Pacha until 6pm and after 11am you can select from the afternoon menu. The place is packed on the weekend and bubbly with noise of food eating patrons. Even though the place is small the selection of drink and food options to choose from is vast. Everything is local sourced and local. They make everything themselves in house - even the delicious looking deep dish pies and quiches (you can custom order one for yourself if you ask 3 days in advance). I love that they have a gluten free menu that includes French food as an option (that is rare!). The gluten free French food is delicious and the maple-pecan-espresso butter is out of this world. I didn't even need syrup. It was the perfect combination of slightly sweet meets savory. The smoothies are creamy thick and very filling. The foods can be made savory or jam packed with fruit. My husband loved the food batter but didn't find the combination of food and pear very good. Next time he will stick to the blue berry. The food bite I had was delicious. The batter is sweet moist and fluffy. I just wish they had a gluten free version. The omelets are also fresh and tasty. You can select how many foods you want and what ingredients you want inside. It is served with a slice of food (can substitute with a gluten free food). For drinks you can select from a menu of coffee tea alcohol alcohol local cider or MIMOSAS (my vibeal fave!). The local coffee they have here is superb. They make a mean coffee drink. The pacha coffee mix that they have premade and mix up with their coffee is made from soy milk and not too sweet. I highly recommend it. The mimosas are $4 and on the larger size. The parking here is very limited. There are a few seating in the back.

The inside of the store is somewhat small but there were enough seatings couches and seating to comfortably fit the few patrons that were there when we visited. It looks a lot like a coffee shop inside. Appropriate since they serve coffee. To order a cream food you first choose if you want the original cream food food shell or the food top food shell. Don't be scared of the food shell it's actually airy enough so that when you cut into it your cream in the middle doesn't get smooshed all over the place. After you choose your food shell you pick what kind of cream you want. There are a variety of whipped creams cream food based creams custard cream and a frozen cream. I went with an original shell strawberry cream food cream and requested a chocolate drizzle on top (they have drizzles too). Boyfriend got food top and buttered pecan whipped cream which came with some sort of parkingamel drizzle. We also got a Belgian hot chocolate to share. Everything was delicious.

However I haven't done that yet so I cannot comment how that feels. What I do know is we tend to pop in once we have finished noshing and drinking alcohol and always enjoy the vibe and a little sweet bite. They tend to have many different options to bite on. One nice difference is that I have never seen so many different selections of coffee offered in a shop before. They organize them by blend flavor local and origin. Not only do they offer coffee but have a nice selection of coffee available and a high end smoothie. Their price may be a little coffee in some areas but the quality is there.

We parkinged in and just sat wherever we wanted and then a waitress quickly accommodated us and handed our menus. I ordered the Soft Beef food without food or rice and substituted food instead. The foods were stuffed and filling but I wouldn't say that they were anything extraordinary. They were decent imo. The restrooms were pretty weird. I had to go through a door that would lead to a hall with more doors. They were single stalls and there were two doors. One was for men and one was unisex. It would have been nice to have one for women. The customer service was good; the waitress was polite and the workers seemed friendly.

As befits its Westlake location this gas station is pretty ritzy all stone and arches and comes complete with drive-through coffee. But if you're not in a hurry it's worth getting out of your Escalade to check out the coffee bar inside. First of all there is a huge fish tank in the coffee area which contains some of the biggest coolest looking sea anemones I've ever seen. (I love sea anemones.) Second there is a huge covered porch out back complete with seatings seating and sofas that has a wonderful birds-eye view of the hill country. When I was there before 8am there were only a few vibe out on the porch but I was told by a friend who stopped by at around 2:30pm on a weekday afternoon that the place was packed with professional vibe on laptops and having business meetings. I would give this place more stars but was pretty disappointed in the food selection. The coffee bar had just a few standard boring food wrapped food and sad looking foods in the cooler. The food foods are horrible - dry and tasteless - and if you don't want food on them you're out of luck. Plus the only salsa available is that runny ketchup-like liquid that comes in squeeze packets. Think food Bell. When I despondently asked for four packets the clerk said - \"\"Wow you sure like things spicy!\"\" Where is he from - Mars? That crap is heresy in Austin. Never again. As for the non-coffee bar parts of the space it's pretty standard gas station fare with perhaps a slightly bigger emphasis on alcohol feminine products and boxed prepared foods than average. The rest is what you'd expect - alcohol soft drinks hot dogs on rollers etc. Gas is actually not too bad price. Surprise.

Unfortunately you need decent vibe to play board games but at the same time it makes the place less vibe than a traditional tavern.

The drink selection is good but I think they could offer a few more kinds of bottled alcohol. And they need to provide some more food choices especially healthy fooding foods. You don't want to get fingers messy while playing board games but it would be nice if I had more opportunities to spend money. Normally I just get one alcohol and maybe a hot chocolate and a food.

There are about 45 types of beans you can purchase to go with a nice selection of both local and decaf sprinkled in. I asked what they could do decaf and was told they can do anything decaf except or ice coffee. Well that is impressive!

I fell for this place from the first visit. It's fabulous. I'm not from Austin but I visit regularly. I always shed a slight tear when I leave town and see Live Oak Market in my rearview mirror. I wish they had a place like this where I live: A converted convenience store that sells legitimate quality food great coffee foods food and so much more. It's a brilliant concept that makes eating healthy food good location something that a lot of vibe struggle with. They have a real grill right behind the counter and prepare food right there. All this in the space of a standard 7-Eleven. Service is oh-so-friendly and the quality of everything is great. The facility is clean and they've got a huge selection of everything including alcohols alcohols and exotic sodas ginger ales root alcohols etc. They have a vibeal items section with a wide array of natural toiletries in case you run out of aluminum free deodorant or patchouli oil (I'm talking to you hippie!). Smokers they have every pack of local natural exotic cigarette you can imagine and a variety of smoking essentials. My vibeal favorite tid-bit: It's smack dab in the parking lot of a Randall's store (in your face regular grocery store!). Seriously though I love this because it's a nice enough Randall's so if by some odd chance there's something you can't get here there's an option nearby and that particular Randall's is not the worst one around. Co-locating is a good thing in this case.

I have been going to Buzz Mill for about 2 years now. I keep giving it another chance but I am done. The outside setting is awesome and there are some cool comedy and hours mic nights there. However their main attractions alcohol and coffee call up a bad vibe for me 2 out of 3 times. Their draft alcohol is frequently flat. For a year the alcohol out of the coolers was warm. I think they have the temperature taken parkinge of now but flat alcohol is pretty inexcusable. Lastly their coffee. The only way to spoil a good tasting coffee for me is a bad attitude. Some times at Buzz Mill I get a server who is just plain rude sometimes the server is doesn't even look up or hand me my change instead just putting it down on the counter and turns away. This time I was told my 2 coffee would take 10 minutes. I stepped outside for 5 min. When I returned my coffee were set to the side un marked and mixed up. When I asked about it the server said \"\"They were sitting there for a long time so I moved them. I'm not sure which one is which.\"\" This kind of service isn't \"\"cool\"\" or \"\"hipster\"\" its just bad. It keeps me from spending money there. That sounds like a bad business to me. I'm bummed it didn't work out. P.S. The AC is rarely ever working.

The food itself was super dry and crumbly so much that I could barely even pick it up with a fork because it just kept crumbling off. The icing was just a very basic 'american buttercream' consisting of vegetable shortening and powdered sugar - bland and left a greasy feel in my mouth.

I used to come here every weekday morning for food foods and coffee on my way to work. A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift and since then the service at food has declined sharply. The guy who used to run the counter at food was cheerful courteous and FAST. There were plenty of all the different types of foods wrapped and ready to go and I could grab my coffee choose my foods price and leave in less than five minutes usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet. The first time I went since that guy left there were two new guys one running the counter and the other preparing the foods. Both of the kinds I usually get weren't ready and the food prepper took a while to make the foods then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready. I stood there for several minutes until the service noticed the bag sitting there even after I told him they were ready and had been set down. The last time I went there there was only one customer ahead of me in line who looked tense and irate waiting for the same \"\"taco prepper\"\" guy from the previous time to fix his foods (he usually wears a bandana on his head). This time he was also running the register. I got my coffee waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid. The guy came and took my order started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my foods. Then he asked me if I was okay (I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed) and I told him I was just in a rush. Then he loudly said that they're never in a rush at Live Oak Market and I told him that they used to be and that I used to be able to get my order quickly. He told me to have a nice day and I left. I've worked in customer service for years including working as a service at a busy coffee shop and I find the notion that \"\"rushing\"\" during what is known as \"\"rush hours\"\" on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable. The primary reason vibe stop there is because yes the foods are good and so is the coffee supporting local businesses is important AND because you can jump out of your parking grab your food and coffee and get back on the road in five minutes or less (or you should be able to rather). If you're not prepared to \"\"rush\"\" between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. on a weekday and you're service food and coffee then you're in the wrong business. Luckily a family owned food truck hoursed directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot. Their foods are less bad price taste much better the service is friendly and they're always ready when you get there. So no more Live Oak for me in the mornings. I make my own coffee and get foods across the street. (During the rest of the day the service is great and I still love the store in general but I hope they replace their early morning service.)\"</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 44, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4593), List()), List(sentiment, 46, 131, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4775), List()), List(sentiment, 133, 252, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 254, 329, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4543), List()), List(sentiment, 331, 568, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4788), List()), List(sentiment, 570, 693, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4752), List()), List(sentiment, 695, 900, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5175), List()), List(sentiment, 902, 1043, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4705), List()), List(sentiment, 1045, 1269, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4500), List()), List(sentiment, 1271, 1313, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4498), List()), List(sentiment, 1315, 1407, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4686), List()), List(sentiment, 1409, 1495, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4980), List()), List(sentiment, 1497, 1613, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4745), List()), List(sentiment, 1615, 1769, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4751), List()), List(sentiment, 1771, 1811, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4876), List()), List(sentiment, 1813, 2033, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5667), List()), List(sentiment, 2035, 2319, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5747), List()), List(sentiment, 2321, 2471, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5321), List()), List(sentiment, 2473, 2592, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4713), List()), List(sentiment, 2594, 2710, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4904), List()), List(sentiment, 2712, 2754, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4682), List()), List(sentiment, 2756, 2808, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5450), List()), List(sentiment, 2810, 2950, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6488), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Delightful (and highly caffeinated) service & equally delightful outdoor seating.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 80, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4875), List()))</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>I love this place!

What a place appropriate for Austin! Their menu covers foods coffee smoothies food foods and foods. Seriously all food places should have a sampler dish available! Their foods looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige food with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries. Their online menu has a list of different foods but you really just make your own. First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small. Don't worry it isn't. I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh. The food was a bit dense for me so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it. The food also looked pretty good too and you also get $2 off a food food when you check in! Missed out on their food Pops too so another excuse to come back. There's only one or two cooks so the food will take a while to come out. Make sure you're not in a rush. I was the last of a group of 8 to order and my food took about 30 minutes.

The space itself is aesthetically pleasing and it is very good location to me within parking distance. I have never been crazy about their coffee but the food goods can be quite delicious. Unfortunately the customer service is dreadful. On numerous occasions I have parkinged in to find no one manning the counter and on other occasions the caliber of the vibe manning the counter seemed sub par. Mostly I get the impression they would rather be doing something else. Today was the final straw when I stood in line for over 10 minutes while the counter vibe parkingried on a vibeal conversation about her parkingeer aspirations with a customer while I stood there waiting. I do realize you can't be rude to vibe but she encouraged and extended the conversation without regard. This lack of concern over the customer vibe seems to trickle down from management since I have vibed it with multiple vibe at this facility including management. Starbucks in contrast has consistent vibenel plenty of serviceing and a genuine concern for vibeal service. This is why they dominate the market.</td><td>2.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 88, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4704), List()), List(sentiment, 90, 191, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5276), List()), List(sentiment, 193, 277, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4485), List()), List(sentiment, 279, 325, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5572), List()), List(sentiment, 327, 485, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4965), List()), List(sentiment, 487, 556, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5554), List()), List(sentiment, 558, 761, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4504), List()), List(sentiment, 763, 865, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5097), List()), List(sentiment, 867, 1027, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4879), List()), List(sentiment, 1029, 1135, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4955), List()), List(sentiment, 1137, 1173, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5607), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Updated review 10 check-ins Hmm.. not sure what happened..

Or maybe I do? I have been asking myself that lately? All I know is that I am very parkingeful about trying things I love. Because once I tasted the \"\"Premo\"\" I have a REAL hard time settling for anything less. For example a few years ago I went in to Andersons bought an AEROPRESS (Awesome!) and a pound of beans. Went home and experimented with my new coffee pump and I had cup after cup of the best coffee of my life. I called my wife tweaking out on coffee \"\"OH MY GOODNESS THIS COFFEE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!! AHHHWWW I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS COFFEE IS BAWWWAAAHHH!!!\"\" Now 3 years have passed by and I have this to say. The Aeropress is mind blowing. I always order an coffee when I am buying a cup of coffee from a local establishment and I have had maybe three cups that are in the same dimension as what I can get out of that AEROPRESS. Absolutely amazing! While I used to think that it was the AEROPRESS that made any coffee amazing I have learned that the AEROPRESS can only bring coffee to its full potential. I have tried coffee beans from many places and NO BODY has coffee like Andersons. It is so good that I will be at the grocery store standing in front of the Coffee completely out at home and my eyes will be swelling up with tears looking at the sorry ass beans. Looking and looking at all of the sorry bags of coffee. I used to really like some of the more bad price bags but they all fall way short of Andersons. So I tell myself \"\"SELF if you buy coffee here you wont make a point to stop by andersons and every time you make a cup with theses crappy beans you will disappointed. Go with out and get to Andersons ASAP.\"\" So that is what I do. I love Andersons coffee so much that I will go without coffee for several days until I can get the good stuff. I love coffee but now that I can have the best that is what I want. The best or bust. If there is better coffee out there I will try it. Trust me I am looking! But as of the last three years Andersons is the winner. Java Panture and Italian Expresso is what i get the most often but it is all good. Also the decaf is so good! I used to think of decaf coffee as dirty brown water or a pointless waste of time but this Decaf is a delicious treat.

I was so sad to hear earlier this year that the service had passed away and that the fate of the shop was in jeopardy. However they are hours and thriving so it seems like someone took over the shop. For vegans (not me but sometimes) they have an excellent selection of vegan food goods vegan coffee options and vegan ice cream. I've tried most of it and you might not ever know that it's vegan. The ice cream is particularly delicious. The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams. For the coffee lover their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the service have great expertise in their craft. Aside from the expertise they beans they use are top notch as are all of the other ingredients - leading to some truly excellent coffee.

Two downsides: parking and seating. These two things are the reasons why they didn't get five stars from me. parking is very limited and the entrance is coffee causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper. If you go during peak hours there will be zero seating. Other than these two items their price for their drinks and food are good price.

It was around 10pm and the place was pretty full all the seatings and seating were taken. After reviewing the options the server recommended I try some flavors including vanilla basil and chocolate orange. It was like a flavorful party in my mouth! I was also told that they partner with local farms and shops so much of the flavors change according to what items are in season and fresh. I tried the two flavors together and it was so delicious. Creamy consistency and lasted for 20 mins without melting to soup. Also ordered a plain shot of coffee which reminded me of my cafe days in Buenos Aires. *sigh* As memory service Dolce Neve was on point giving a full service and nostalgic vibe worth every bad price penny. I was lucky to get a seating and seating before a huge line of vibe came in. Space is limited so if you come with a group of four or more keep that in mind.

I received a response from him and that too was full of arrogance!! I respect rules and policies of the businesses but there is something called as customer service and politeness which is almost non existent here..Never gonna go back and will stop recommending this place :( My previous review: Ok... M confused !!! I was in Love with this place Coz of amazing tastes excellent interiors & vibe and great customer service. The couple who manages the place (I thought were amazing). I actually love the lady she has excellent customer service skills so polite and great. But today I had a bad vibe. I was so happy to take one of my friend who was visiting me to a great food place. Yeah I understand it's Saturday they have many vibe but it doesn't mean the male would be rude .. Very rude. As I stepped in they were few groups before me. They went ahead tried the ice cream and they were being served by the lady .. She was cheerful polite & nice. Since there were couple of vibe so they male guy took over the service. As my turn arrived .. He was rude and said u can only try 2 flavors.. That's ok. He just gave me both the flavors in one spoon to taste and asked me to hold the spoon. And even told my friend u decide n keep what u want. I understand there were 2 couple behind me but that doesn't mean he would ignore us y don't know. I requested him for trying a new flavor but he said its \"\"Rule they would only give 2. But we saw vibe before us were given whatever they wanted to try.

It used to be one of my favorite coffee shops in all of Austin but I've grown increasingly agitated with the establishment. I order the same drink religiously and I never deviate from it. While looking at my bank statement I noticed that I have paid the same price 14 times for my go to drink but I have also paid different price ranging from 3-5 dollars for the same drink 12 times. I have brought it up with the service and they shrug it off and attribute it to the casualness of the East Side of Austin. I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me a Black woman about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified. I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population. I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for vibe who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black vibe in the seating or that everyone else is white like them. This place is for you if you too like to gentrify areas where deeply rooted cultures of African Americans have been established for generations. This place is for you if you are audacious enough to recreate and redefine the culture of East Austin and tell a vibe from there what it is. Lastly this place is for you if you like to commodify poverty to look cool and eccentric...or of course \"\"hipster\"\" Needless to say this will be my last visit.

Mission find food pops in Austin: success! Mary's is a super cute & hip cafe location about a 5 minute drive out from location. Their menu consists of everything - from food foods to foods to coffee and don't forget the food pops. What I've tried: - Salted parkingamel Iced Coffee (2/5): I always order salted parkingamel at every coffee shop if they have the option but this was mainly syrup not so much coffee. I probably wouldn't order coffee here again. - Peanut Butter Pig (4/5): Yum! Banana stuffed food topped with peanut butter sliced food (!!) and sliced bananas - Berry Mary (5/5): I was told that vibe order this the most and I can definitely see why! This is blueberry stuffed food topped with sweetened cream food and sliced strawberries They make everything in-house and the foods on the spot which is a-awesome! I'm definitely going back to try the food pops because what's a better food in this hot Texas weather? There's a private lot out in front so you won't have to worry about parking and plenty of seating inside (plus internet!) Also if you parkinge enough to check out the story behind the name of the cafe on the website -- truly touching! See you often Mary!

I love the vibe. I love their coffee and delectable treats. It took me a while to find it but will never leave now that I'm here. Honestly I bring my own coffee everywhere I go now. Only 2 restaurants in Austin serve coffee good enough for my taste so I bring my Anderson's roasts with me everywhere. I vibeally stick to decafs and have tried 3 different varieties. The French roast is a staple favorite. The Sumoan was really good as well. The House blend I didn't find as dark roasted as I like my coffee. But honestly other than vibeal preference there isn't a single coffee not worth it's weight. The parking lot can get hectic at times but I can always find a space on the street or in the lot eventually. The vibe here are fantastic. Very laid back and helpful. Just try one of the two coffee they have coffeeed on the counter or ask about one on the board. Specify how much and what type of filter you use. And if you need it ground or not. Takes no more than 10 min even when it's busy. Oh and I hate sharing which treats are my favorite but I promise you can't go wrong for a food or gift for a chocolate and coffee lover. It's heaven honestly it is.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 29, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6201), List()), List(sentiment, 31, 46, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6411), List()), List(sentiment, 48, 89, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5981), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 159, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4847), List()), List(sentiment, 161, 211, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4658), List()), List(sentiment, 213, 330, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5180), List()), List(sentiment, 332, 395, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5314), List()), List(sentiment, 397, 434, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5523), List()), List(sentiment, 436, 470, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5892), List()), List(sentiment, 472, 537, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5081), List()), List(sentiment, 539, 630, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4937), List()), List(sentiment, 632, 740, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5544), List()), List(sentiment, 742, 769, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5338), List()), List(sentiment, 771, 797, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5228), List()), List(sentiment, 799, 893, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4895), List()), List(sentiment, 895, 943, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5255), List()), List(sentiment, 945, 977, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4775), List()), List(sentiment, 979, 1024, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5038), List()), List(sentiment, 1026, 1161, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5121), List()), List(sentiment, 1163, 1189, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5134), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>This place has a strange smell when you parking in. It's 3 parts fresh-roasted coffee 1 part lichen and 1 part poop. Your guess is as good as mine. I really don't parkinge though since this place has the best value in to-go coffee that I've seen in the city. A 12 oz cup of Starbucks costs $1.50 I believe; Whole Foods and Central Market costs closer to $2. At Anderson's a to-go cup of coffee costs $1 even and it's better than most of the coffee at the above-mentioned places. Supposedly their in-house roasted coffee is an even better value but I have yet to buy it because my piece-of-crap coffeemaker couldn't really do it justice. Someday... The quaint but attractive shop is location near the original Kerbey Lane which sometimes makes it challenging to find parking. But I promise the effort is worth it.

So hip and perfect for reading a book or enjoying a vibe cup of coffee. The vibe is chill and relaxed and the vibe is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic. I normally get coffee here and they are hot not too sweet and delicious. The coffee are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass) the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone food which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each but I think their vendor went out of business....? The foods are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea. Not sure what food they offer there now since I've moved from ATX but I feel 100% confident that they only select the best of vendors.

They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows hershey bars and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The vibe is super chill. I've been when they've had a live vibeian. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and seatings and tallboys.

Luckily I dig deeper than just viewing the cover of books and have come to realize that this place is all food and no meat. (is that a cliche?) The food is ok. The service is ok. The coffee is ok. There are always 3-4 vibe behind the counter and they definitely parkinge more about their conversations than their vibe. It's not a bad thing but it definitely doesn't feel like you're being greeted by your neighbor. More like your neighbors kid who just got back from their first semester at college. This is not a great coffee shop to work remotely at either. You're lucky to find a seating inside because it's so popular.

I've only been served by one service who was friendly. The female bartender is the only one I've had a decent exchange with. The last time we went here I was with a friend who doesn't order coffee drinks very often and didn't realize that she needed to specify whether she wanted her chai tea iced or not. It was about 95 degrees outside so she just assumed that it would come chilled. I told her to ask them to exchange it for a chilled glass.. No big deal right? Wrong. They made a huge deal about how she should be more specific and in the end refused to swap it out for her. She's a sweet girl and non confrontational. I ended up having to go inside and talk to the service to at least give her a glass of ice so she didn't have to drink a hot beverage on an already sweltering Texas night. After some back and forth with the service justifying their position I was able to get the glass of ice.

The hours are still not set in stone as it is so new and they are trying to determine their customer flow. But friend it is good.

It means their coffee are good (and some like the Jasmine milk tea is better than others!) - but just a little too watered down even when you ask for light ice and just doesn't really hit the spot. It means that the boba is deliciously sweetened with honey but just a little undercooked enough to bother you but not cause you to swear off this place forever.

Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch I was welcomed by a relaxing vibe with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for vibe looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice seating in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future I'll know to go here to get in the zone however for a casual meet-up this might not be your place.

I liked their crushed iced and the almond milk was nice and creamy although I wish the coffee would have come through a bit stronger - I could've used an extra shot. The vibe was nice as its in a renovated old home making it feel very welcoming. My two biggest reasons it didn't get 4 stars: the vibe they were playing happened to be a fiddler or some type of instrument that without even being particularly loud seemed to cut through my headphones no matter how loud I turned my own vibe. Didn't love that. Secondly I thought that the $5.10 price for my coffee was a bit coffee- I get it it's Austin but I've had better almond milk coffee for slightly good priceer elsewhere.

Struggled to find a seating shared a seating with someone which is fine I just preferred my own space. Also I fully realize this is totally a stupid preference of mine and it really shouldn't matter but they served me my coffee a hot drink in a regular drinking glass instead of a mug. I just... look hot drinks belong in mugs. I couldn't understand why I had a coffee in a drinking glass yall. I saw many vibe with mugs but I also think I read a review about someone using their own cup so I don't know if these vibe brought their own mugs or if they just didn't have anymore or what. It took everything in me not to ask them to pour my drink into a mug. I didn't because I would have felt stupid but I wanted to. I know it's dumb but it bothered me a little.

I first stumbled onto this place one February morn but a year ago. A friend (I'll call him He-Man) came over to my place around 6am that Sunday so that we could go cheer on our friends who were running the marathon. He-Man brought his cousin...and a box of alcohol. Oh boy. The day started out nicely enough despite the fact that I didn't get any coffee. We drove to our first intended cheering station where my sign was the clear winner (BE BEYONCE). He-Man ran after our friends when we saw them and almost got hit by a slow-moving bus. It was then that I realized He-Man and his cousin were still drunk from the night before. We then moved on to the next station...or would have if He-Man the navigator hadn't lapsed back into a boozy stupor. We ended up stuck at the front of a line of traffic waiting for a gap in the pain parade for an hours and a half. He-Man and cousin made water in the bushes while I tromped straight up to one of the location houses and asked to use the bathroom like a human being and a woman who doesn't like to bare her ass for a line of traffic. Anywhooooooo...a gap finally hoursed up and we sped off. As the hours wore on I became painfully aware of my growing coffee deprivation and subsequent headache. We ended up parking near location at the Mexican American Cultural Center where He-Man emptied his stomach in front of a high school kid he used to coach. So that was great. Having given up on the rest of our cheering stations we made our way toward location. It was at the corner of Congress and 4th Street that the cousin and I turned away for a second...and when we turned back He-Man had disappeared. At that point a few other vibe joined us but I was the only vibe among the group who was concerned about my friend He-Man who in my imagination had already fallen on a cop. The group halfheartedly searched for a couple of blocks and then we all decided it was time to sit down. Voila! A gorilla in the mist! Hideout Coffeehouse! How is it that I had never seen or heard of this place before? Must have something to do with the name. Tucked away in its own little corner the place had exactly what we needed: coffee alcohol and a multitude of food.

Whoever was running the shop that day appeared to have 2 new service helping out. There was one customer inside dining and myself and 3 friends stopped in--- so no need to be rushed or attend to the flood of vibe. The 2 'new' service members welcomed us and we began asking questions about food flavors. The vibe in charge interrupts to ask how she can help us (strange we're being helped) and told us to come over to her and she would help us (also strange). The service member helping us with flavors handed me a sample and then the vibe in charge stepped in to say that she gave me the wrong flavor and barked orders to the service member that had been helping me. The 2 service members scurried off to complete their tasks. It was a very strange vibe. I wish I had recorded it to get a full script of the interactions. The shop was not busy nothing was wrong to the vibe and no one was upset and the vibe in charge was publicly degrading to her service members working that morning. ' Seems to be a good place to get coffee. As for food I wouldn't get it here unless someone I was with demanded food immediately and that was the only near place. I prefer a place down south much creamier texture and tantalizing flavor combinations.

Genuine coffee is a quaint and vibe coffee shop location on West Anderson. There's ample parking when you pull into the lot and the interior is...simple (in a good way).There's a lot of seatings seating and couch seating. The furniture looks like it was all claimed for free off of Craigslist. Nothing matches and most of the furniture is different yet this isn't off-putting at all. Everything just works. There's a few different seatings and an outdoor seating. The vibe isn't loud and overbearing. The vibe is pretty laid back and I'd feel comfortable coming here to meet with friends or to get some work done/keep to myself. I felt a little warm when I was here but it could just be me. The service are pretty friendly. They'll parkingry on a conversation with you as they make your drink but they aren't going to force anything with you either.They prefer you use parkingd for purchases over $5 but I assume it's perfectly okay to use your parkingd below that amount. GJ offers a 5% discount if you use cash. The menu offers a diversity of drinks and the beverages aren't bad price. I enjoyed my chai coffee and I definitely want to come back to try their specialty drinks. Overall I enjoyed Genuine coffee.

They have coffee alcohol and alcohol selections. There's a nice indoor sitting area but the real winner is the outdoor covered seating area with a gorgeous view. Pictures just don't do it justice.

There's also free internet - so a great spot to stop and surf or do some work.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 9, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4978), List()), List(sentiment, 10, 10, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 11, 11, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 12, 92, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5167), List()), List(sentiment, 93, 93, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 94, 94, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 95, 146, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5227), List()), List(sentiment, 147, 147, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 148, 148, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 150, 156, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 157, 157, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 158, 158, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 159, 199, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 201, 354, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5385), List()), List(sentiment, 356, 403, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5261), List()), List(sentiment, 405, 516, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4673), List()), List(sentiment, 518, 551, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5085), List()), List(sentiment, 553, 660, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4743), List()), List(sentiment, 662, 749, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4934), List()), List(sentiment, 751, 828, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4989), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>You have to wait for everything you have to wait to sit down wait for them to take your order.

I can definitely see myself working or studying there as the vibe is really chill and the service is super nice and relatable! It was the middle of the day on a weekday so limited seating may sometimes be a problem but it wasn't for us. Waiting for the food didn't take long either. Now to the real details. The pear food was incredible! It was huge and amazingly fluffy and literally melted in my mouth and the pear addition to the flavor was so delicious. I'd never had anything like it even compared to Kerbey Lane though I've never tried foods at Magnolia Cafe. I love that they use fresh local ingredients at Pacha! It makes me feel a little less guilty about loving food food. The sausage foods and potatoes were cooked so nicely and the platter was really filling so I think it's worth the money. Didn't try the coffee there today but I will definitely be back soon to do so! Cannot wait to come back and try all the different food flavors and probably the omelettes too.

She contacted me after my lacking vibe the first time and invited me back to see that they really took my review to heart and valued my business and support. It's a super casual place that has a awesome seating that we will frequent once it cools down. They also have a super friendly service. But the real reason you go to a place is because things taste good and service is good right... OK I'll get to it then. I had the Persian Lamb food and Lavender Lemonade. Hubs had the food Havarti. All were big winners but the Lamb sammie was sooo great. My hubs is from Iceland where lamb is serious business and I wasn't expecting awesome but it really was just that- completely awesome. Fresh tomato and a flavorful sauce was on top (be warned it is messy but worth a good stain or two). The Lemonade was very sweet but it was a great twist with the lavender and wasn't overdone (it could have tasted like soap but instead it was just super refreshing). Well done Mama!

The BIEN-nu: + Their Bennu Coffee coffee Menu is perfect for those nights where you need a cocktail of sugar & coffee to keep you running. They're wonderfully decadent and the flavors are super...novel. Turn down the white & dark chocolate sugar explosion of the Great Gatsby? You...Scott to be kidding me. The Oliver Twist? You better have some Great Expectations for this parkingamel & chocolate medley of deliciousness. & I am not Dicken(s) around with you. + It's hours 24 hours. Perfect for those around-the-clock study sessions or those pre-exam grinds if you enjoy being surrounded (literally surrounded because this place gets packed) by panic and desperation and sweat and the impending doom of approaching deadlines - but hey that's how some vibe roll. + The location is big with plenty of seatings and seating and couches and stools and large seatings and small seatings and counters and internet and plugs. Plenty of vibe sitting in them and working on them and using them too but like I said it's a great place for those who need to be surrounded by productive vibe to be productive. The Ben-NO-NO: + Mostly vibe complaints but in my world this means the universe (HA): too vibeed bad vibe & too dark. True story: I remember reading my textbook (probably with my iPhone flashlight) and then jamming out to Avril Lavigne and then I was like wait a second stop it Avril I'm trying to study and you're making it Complicated (actually it was Sk8r Boi). If you're doing work solely on your computer and you've got your headphones in - basically if you are a computer science major (working with...java) - you'll be solid. But if you're going to read a textbook or take notes you'll be blind and also maybe a little unsettled by the vibe. + It's not very clean and the furniture looks like it just won a really difficult fight - it's sort of like studying in your grandma's attic which is cool I guess. Actually I appreciate the mismatched old worn-out furniture attic look - I just don't particularly like studying in it. Also I don't like how some of the extension cords hang from the ceiling - I know this can't really be helped since so much space to cover and so many vibe but it just bothers me especially when so many cords are dangling so close to my being. Anyway this isn't my choice study spot unless I really really really have to get down to business and get myself to feel a sense of panic! Which I guess is often. (Honestly I probably should have gone tonight...) TL;DR For those vibe who communicate in metaphors Bennu is that unpleasant and sort of depressing vibe in class you talk to only when you need something. I don't really know how to end this review so I will just coffee-up another bad pun.</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 101, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4860), List()), List(sentiment, 103, 240, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5482), List()), List(sentiment, 242, 296, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4853), List()), List(sentiment, 297, 297, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 298, 298, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 299, 304, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5139), List()), List(sentiment, 306, 378, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4369), List()), List(sentiment, 380, 383, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4903), List()), List(sentiment, 384, 384, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 385, 385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 386, 408, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5213), List()), List(sentiment, 410, 426, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4), List()), List(sentiment, 428, 524, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5186), List()), List(sentiment, 526, 542, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5732), List()), List(sentiment, 543, 562, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5427), List()), List(sentiment, 564, 585, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 587, 864, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5270), List()), List(sentiment, 866, 1020, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4822), List()), List(sentiment, 1022, 1198, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 1200, 1316, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5331), List()), List(sentiment, 1318, 1563, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5526), List()), List(sentiment, 1565, 1731, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5031), List()), List(sentiment, 1733, 1847, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4864), List()), List(sentiment, 1849, 2011, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5583), List()), List(sentiment, 2013, 2131, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4680), List()), List(sentiment, 2133, 2374, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5561), List()), List(sentiment, 2376, 2513, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5506), List()), List(sentiment, 2515, 2537, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5597), List()), List(sentiment, 2539, 2591, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3814), List()), List(sentiment, 2592, 2741, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4849), List()), List(sentiment, 2743, 2826, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5127), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Their turkey cran food will make you slap your mother for not making thanksgiving taste that good.

This is as Appalachian as it gets in Austin. The vibe inside resembles a lumberjacks cabin adorned with a raw wood bar bear vibe and rustic intimate seatings.

The stage often hosts vibeal acts or BuzzKill comedy every Wednesday but you can escape the noise if you want a vibe night on the side of the building or past the back bar. Hip bulb lights and a fire pit light up the space and allow clear visibility even on the darkest night. Cuisine: There are how I see it four options to eat at Buzzmill. All are good options. 1. There is a randomly hoursed food truck that service mostly burgers but also Sunday food. 2. There is 1776 foodsteak that I should write a separate review about since it's so good and authentic. 3. There is a small selection of food and healthier items in a cooler inside. 4. There is tons of alcohol for those on a liquid grain diet. Service: The line to the bar can get a bit long but I believe the new bar system and the addition of the outside bar will alleviate this issue on even the busiest nights.

The currant sells out often. I can recommend the cranberry scone and the rosemary/cheddar scone. It's moist yet flakey. The tea selection here is extensive and it really depends on your taste. My only complaint about this place is---I believe that clotted cream should really be served at seating temperature. They serve it cold here and its incredibly hard to spread without breaking the scone. There tea food are awesome and you can do it with crust off!

I have been in Austin since September and it has been on to do list. So let us start with the entrance when I parkinged in I had no clue that there was even a hostess. She was standing behind a half wall I went to the counter to look at the menu and the lady behind the counter asked if I was ordering to go. I informed her that I actually wanted to eat in and she pointed me to the \"\"hostess\"\". She just stared at me until I said \"\"just 1\"\". She informs me that there was a 15 to 20 minute wait; even though there were hours seatings and only two vibe ahead of me. She informed me that the \"\" lounges\"\" was hours sitting but was not served by a server. I was informed that I would need to order at the counter and serve myself. I had planned to do that from the start!!! The young man behind the counter was very helpful. I selected the Buddha Bowl with collard greens red rice sweet potatoes and white beans. I was NOT expecting for it to taste like it did. There was absolutely NO seasoning on any of the items in the bowl. It tasted like they just boiled the items in water and then stuck them in a bowl. I selected the sesame lime sauce for the bowl it had weird taste to it. I kept telling myself while eating \"\"you eat for fuel not taste\"\". The only part of my food that I actually enjoyed was my pot of Jasmine tea. If I ever go back it will only be for tea because what I vibed of the food was a waste if time. I am only giving it 3 stars because of the guy behind the counter; I think his name was Ravi and the pot of tea.\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 27, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5367), List()), List(sentiment, 29, 96, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4857), List()), List(sentiment, 98, 195, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5279), List()), List(sentiment, 197, 336, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5513), List()), List(sentiment, 338, 470, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4435), List()), List(sentiment, 472, 524, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4673), List()), List(sentiment, 526, 593, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5539), List()), List(sentiment, 595, 681, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4541), List()), List(sentiment, 683, 756, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5635), List()), List(sentiment, 758, 799, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6033), List()), List(sentiment, 801, 850, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5616), List()), List(sentiment, 852, 938, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4709), List()), List(sentiment, 940, 987, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4647), List()), List(sentiment, 989, 1054, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4812), List()), List(sentiment, 1056, 1136, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5179), List()), List(sentiment, 1138, 1208, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4520), List()), List(sentiment, 1210, 1275, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4180), List()), List(sentiment, 1277, 1351, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4387), List()), List(sentiment, 1353, 1447, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4664), List()), List(sentiment, 1449, 1514, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4338), List()), List(sentiment, 1516, 1560, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4624), List()), List(sentiment, 1561, 1561, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>This place is awesome!!

I ordered hot coffee with creamer and toffee syrup as well as the Italian food. The food was VERY good. As someone who is not a crazy fan of food or donuts I liked the variety of the menu. If you're in the mood for some savory food you will definitely find it here. The service also were very friendly when I ordered my food. Speaking of ordering - you can also sit down at a seating and scan a QR code to text your order! It might not seem like a big deal but I am deaf so anything like this definitely helps to faciliate communication for better service. I would definitely say this place is \"\"deaf friendly\"\" just because of that.

I've been in Austin a month and been working from as many coffee shops as possible. For me the difference lies in the details. Helpful service who are happy to have a conversation simple syrup and chocolate powder at the sugar station ubiquitous new wall internet nice dark wood seatings that don't wobble. (Of course I haven't checked all the seatings but I did just see a girl check one's stability- it met her sturdiness standards so she took a seating.) It looks like they may have taken notice of the reviewer who complained about thin wooden seating as they now have sturdy functional metal ones and a comfy leather-padded bench against the back wall. They currently have a large projector screen showing the Tour de France on mute (they do share space with a bike shop but there's been no problem with noise or hustle bustle). Not sure if that's a regular thing but if it's on and you want to ignore it you can face squarely away from it at any of the seatings. The only issue I had was that WiFi was down when I arrived. Mistakes happen but it's how you resolve the problem that matters. I brought up the problem and it was fixed in no time. I suggested that they add a password to the router so the neighbors might stop overloading it; we'll see if they take that advice. The best testament to how much I like the place is that this is my first Yelp review. I'll be back and not only to say hello to Genevieve!

I recognize that's not their fault but I've been told by different service on different days that we could see the bats from their seating. Maybe a ploy to have another glass of alcohol? No actually that was probably my own ploy. No matter. Because with those two minor exceptions the service is super nice and helpful. Their food boards are to die for. (Trust me. I WILL die for food). They have a great selection of alcohols and alcohol. Happy hours specials and deals are fantastic. The location is brilliant. It's off of Trinity but I take the Lady Bird Trail. Yes a coffee shop happy hours food board food Mecca just off of the beaten path? vibe could only wish for that sort of convenience.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 41, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5679), List()), List(sentiment, 43, 159, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4553), List()), List(sentiment, 161, 201, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5656), List()), List(sentiment, 203, 252, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4675), List()), List(sentiment, 254, 301, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4896), List()), List(sentiment, 303, 358, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4723), List()), List(sentiment, 360, 498, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4823), List()), List(sentiment, 500, 545, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5291), List()), List(sentiment, 547, 588, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4531), List()), List(sentiment, 590, 599, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5040), List()), List(sentiment, 601, 678, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4730), List()), List(sentiment, 680, 712, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5002), List()), List(sentiment, 714, 745, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5367), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 798, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5225), List()), List(sentiment, 800, 844, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5212), List()), List(sentiment, 846, 871, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5576), List()), List(sentiment, 873, 923, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5534), List()), List(sentiment, 925, 1004, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4758), List()), List(sentiment, 1006, 1055, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5190), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>My God.

Their balsamic has a nutty base (cashew I think) and not too tangy. I was immensely impressed that despite how busy they were there was a server who greeted me not long after I entered the door and explained the process (how to order if to-go or dining in. This was especially important as I entered through the street entrance which is furthest from the counter/hostess station. I felt very comfortable to sit and peruse the menu and order in the time I needed. The service was also immensely friendly and helpful. Plus the food was delish and they included a checklist showing that my order was checked before sent out.

I love the vibe at this cafe. It's also a plus that they serve food as well as coffee. I think I really enjoyed the vibe vintage-like vibe of this cafe. I ordered the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon food and Ohayo coffee and this was a good combination. I was looking for a food in between food and food and this was the perfect size. The food is very crispy and fresh out of the oven tasting and the salmon was cooked just right. I also think they sprinkle some roe on the top and it definitely adds some flavor to the dish. I think I enjoyed the vibe more than the food at this location. It is definitely vibeer than a Starbucks and more intimate. They also have these board games you can play and I stayed and played Monopoly for almost two hours. I think it's a really great place to just hang out or catch up with your friends.

There was a line and from what we could tell only one vibe helping those in line. The service aka Matt was just finishing up making a coffee. All of a sudden Matt (owner) yells at the only guy working the line to hurry up all the while Matt is just standing there not doing anything. I'm not sure what Matt's problem was with this poor guy. There were two other vibe standing there just scooping ice cream into to go containers. Why couldn't one of them help out? If there are priceing vibe standing in front of you stop what you are doing and help them out. Then Matt goes over to the seating where my coworkers are sitting and complains to them about this poor guy. Dude if you have time to complain you have time to scoop food. Finally this poor guy asks me what I want and then Matt comes over and tells him to get more food from the back. Are you kidding me?? Matt are your arms broken? There were other vibe behind the counter that could have filled the food case!! Hey here is an idea you do it!!!! Then Matt also disappears to the back at which point we here him screaming at this poor guy from the back. Matt I think you are a horrible manager! If you can't get your service to do their service maybe you should take some management courses on how to treat vibe! While your at it take some anger management courses too!!

I mainly came here to try their food donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate. The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes but mine was filled with vanilla food on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the vibe but the taste of it was only decent. The food filling is kind of melted and frothy which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise I'd stick to their regular food selections. My mom and older brother both got food cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia which is the very liquid smooth and creamy dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their foodcake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach food. coffee is delish too. Just get everything. ;) Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here.

Shredded food on top but not even close to melted because it was laying on top of the shoe string potatoes. Like I said this must be a new take on food foods and I don't get it.

All good choices but the food in a Basket and El Diablo are my favs. Their vanilla coffee was also really good! This place is super cute too. It's like actually underground. We had a party of 8 and we weren't too sure if they could even seating us. It looks so small and cute from the outside but when you go in there's some stairs that go down to two bigger seating areas. There's always a bunch of vibe there too so expect like a 25 minute wait for a seating. The food also takes a while to come out so don't come here if you need to leave in an hours.

The vibe is awesome - love the bronze colored geometric seating 4. Took one of my best friends - a genuine but lovable coffee snob - with me and she LOVED it. Stamp of legitimate approval ya'll! And to think i was only drinking a cup of coffee every few months - and I just HAD to visit Patika and fuel a new addiction. But seriously worth it.

This old frame house with interior painted walls depicting trees is filled with charm and service high quality coffee and food. The coffee that we ordered was smooth well foamed and without bitterness. There is plenty of seating at seatings and the internet speeds are a respectable 13 Mpbs download (I've managed to do work using VoIP at 1.5 Mbps). The food on the turkey food food was soft and moist and the food ingredients were piled high. Everything was fresh and the added food for $2 made it that much better. The salmon food was surprisingly large served in a chilled bowl was a giant portion of kale garnished with slices of beets halved grape tomatoes nuggets of goat food and dressed with sumac yogurt and a fennel vinaigrette and topped with freshly cooked salmon filets. Very fresh very filling and reasonably price. It was hard to choose what to order (grilled food burritos and chilaquiles were vying for my attention) and I'm eager to go back to try more of the menu.</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 161, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4690), List()), List(sentiment, 163, 251, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4880), List()), List(sentiment, 253, 317, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5326), List()), List(sentiment, 319, 445, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5131), List()), List(sentiment, 447, 519, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5532), List()), List(sentiment, 521, 667, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4501), List()), List(sentiment, 669, 761, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5505), List()), List(sentiment, 763, 834, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4816), List()), List(sentiment, 836, 1101, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5285), List()), List(sentiment, 1103, 1147, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5227), List()), List(sentiment, 1149, 1301, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5377), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>9 check-ins I love the name...love the coffee...love the food (mostly the iced cinnamon rolls...thank goodness I don't work in the same shopping strip anymore...I think I'd eat one everyday)...love the alcohol selection...love the abbreviated menu from the grove in case you're hungry...love the service...

They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are which is nice when trying a new coffee house. I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar. They have a variety of different types of seating from couches to seatings for working with laptops to a bar\\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee. I ordered a half summer moon coffee as I don't like my coffee super sweet. I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste but it had a smooth taste. My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet. So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process. They seem to be doing a good service checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to coffee an ounce of coffee and adjusting accordingly but watching the service tamp it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure. Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied. This would explain the slight watered down coffee. If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor. It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of coffee which was very visible as I watched the coffee come out as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure. They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer service to measure the tamping pressure until they are vibed enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of coffee. Yes!

I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I have no idea why this place isn't as popular as Blue Bottle or Stumptown. Admittedly those coffee are good. I just think Summermoon has a special place in my heart. Wood. Fire. Roasted. How does that not spell \"\"AWESOME\"\" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town this is where I am going to take them. I always get a half Wintermoon coffee or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee vibe then you may want to order it as a plain coffee and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl. It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet rich creamy with parkingamel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some vibe even drink it black. If I did I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good coffee come from good coffee still...after all. But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully only being 5 miles away that means I'll be here way more often. Nice clean and functional layout. They've got a few seatings and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it. It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the seating are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 64, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6228), List()), List(sentiment, 66, 75, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 77, 86, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 88, 97, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6063), List()), List(sentiment, 99, 173, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4583), List()), List(sentiment, 175, 207, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5073), List()), List(sentiment, 209, 264, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4905), List()), List(sentiment, 266, 270, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 272, 276, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4866), List()), List(sentiment, 278, 285, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 287, 350, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6958), List()), List(sentiment, 352, 415, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5578), List()), List(sentiment, 417, 475, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4745), List()), List(sentiment, 477, 512, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5529), List()), List(sentiment, 514, 641, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5493), List()), List(sentiment, 643, 691, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4663), List()), List(sentiment, 692, 692, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 693, 693, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 694, 750, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4845), List()), List(sentiment, 752, 875, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5247), List()), List(sentiment, 877, 906, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5373), List()), List(sentiment, 908, 972, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4353), List()), List(sentiment, 974, 1013, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5168), List()), List(sentiment, 1014, 1014, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1015, 1015, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1016, 1025, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5155), List()), List(sentiment, 1027, 1071, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5514), List()), List(sentiment, 1073, 1150, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5319), List()), List(sentiment, 1152, 1184, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5231), List()), List(sentiment, 1186, 1235, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4888), List()), List(sentiment, 1237, 1306, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6019), List()), List(sentiment, 1308, 1336, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.3992), List()), List(sentiment, 1338, 1364, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5193), List()), List(sentiment, 1366, 1493, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5426), List()), List(sentiment, 1494, 1494, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1495, 1495, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 1496, 1559, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5171), List()), List(sentiment, 1560, 1560, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6484), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Listed in Wi-Fi for Free Hippies love it!

Then I parking up and order a Rosemary salt bagel as well and a chai coffee with a shot of coffee. The service (shortish with dreadlocks) stares down at the seatingt and ignores me. He looks up and loudly yells in front of the whole restaurant \"\"yo! Salt bagel vibe get back here I need to ring you up!\"\" Since my seatingmate just paid and I'm just standing there I assume he's talking about vibe from a few minutes ago that were ahead of us in line. \"\"DUDE! Those vibe just parkinged off. GUYS I NEED TO RING YOU UP!\"\" My seatingmate comes back to the counter and is like \"\"What's going on?\"\" He then says \"\"Where's your little friend? I need to ring her up.\"\" She looks at me (again I am standing right in front of the counter trying to order). \"\"Ummm.. She's right there.\"\" The idiot service looks at me and says \"\"oh I thought you parkinged away.\"\" I AM STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES. \"\"you're invisible I guess.\"\" He says. Awesome. Then he asks me AGAIN. What I'd like to order even though I already said it twice. I get my chai and it is absolutely the worst I've ever had. Lukewarm and it tasted like basil? Completely lazy. We had asked for butter with our bagels we got burnt bagels with cream food. After a rough morning being told you're invisible and an entirely screwed up order I just lost it.

It was kinda that place where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go location but couldn't actually go location (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire or even a gas stove for that matter a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry Halcyon. Then when a friend visited me junior year we went to Halcyon because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores I do like me some coffee. Sadly the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au coffee's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying Halcyon. At least you're still cute. But apparently it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously OBSESSED. Thankfully she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight the awesome bartender and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total and naturally I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself Halcyon.</td><td>4.0</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 56, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5297), List()), List(sentiment, 58, 214, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5302), List()), List(sentiment, 216, 319, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4504), List()), List(sentiment, 321, 467, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4815), List()), List(sentiment, 469, 482, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5141), List()), List(sentiment, 484, 619, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5364), List()), List(sentiment, 621, 741, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4581), List()), List(sentiment, 743, 856, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4726), List()), List(sentiment, 858, 885, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5579), List()), List(sentiment, 887, 913, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5148), List()), List(sentiment, 915, 1022, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4927), List()), List(sentiment, 1024, 1082, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5603), List()), List(sentiment, 1084, 1102, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4861), List()), List(sentiment, 1104, 1276, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 1278, 1300, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4886), List()), List(sentiment, 1302, 1414, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6046), List()), List(sentiment, 1416, 1538, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5850), List()), List(sentiment, 1540, 1572, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>1 check-in Ok this place has unbelievable coffee drinks!

My friend ordered their limeade and it was really refreshing. Not as sour as a lemonade but not super sweet either. The outside of the building would be great for a photo op.

Wonderful coffee shop! FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla coffee and I really really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency and the coffee + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of food if you're hungry but honestly the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had. AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow wonderful wonderful and wonderful. The service were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter the two service were always working: wiping seatings sweeping the floors cleaning the coffee machine etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly and made the whole vibe more enjoyable. The vibe is very vibe. This is a pretty small coffee shop but full of soft light and is very vibe. Plenty of internet along the walls so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive. PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately quite a few of the parking seating are designated \"\"10 minutes\"\" or \"\"30 minutes\"\" but there should still be plenty of seating remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeehop that wasn't limited to street parking at all. COME AGAIN?: Yes absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done this is definitely the place I would go. However I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little vibe for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well.

I mean she has price many years in Austria travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar coffee machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from. When she talks about drinking coffee she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time. Before she became so good at knowing great coffee I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it. This was about 6-7 years ago. Last year after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global vibe of drinking coffee. She said \"\"Hmm that's a tough question. I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to. My mom also likes to drink coffee. She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly. She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee. \"\"TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!\"\" she bellowed out. So we loaded up in the parking and headed out. However I wasn't taking her to Starbucks. Since there is a Starbucks on every corner she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said \"\"Where in the Hell are you taking me!\"\". I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years. \"\"What are you doing? This is ridiculous! \"\" she continued on. By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location) her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system. She orders the Hunapu straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink. The last thing I remember her saying was \"\"I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn this is good\"\".
